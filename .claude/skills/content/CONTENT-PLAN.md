## SEO Strategy Overview

### Why This Matters
QRWolf relies 100% on organic traffic - no paid ads. Content is our primary acquisition channel.

### Search Volume Context
- **5.1M+ monthly searches** for QR code-related terms
- **~1M searches/month** for QR code generator tools
- **61K searches/month** for business card QR codes alone
- Long-tail keywords = 91.8% of all Google searches
- Long-tail conversion rate: **36%** (vs ~2% for head terms)

### Content Priorities
1. **High-volume head terms** - "qr code generator", "free qr code" (build authority)
2. **Long-tail "how to" queries** - "how to create wifi qr code" (capture intent)
3. **Type-specific keywords** - "[type] qr code generator" for each of 16 types
4. **Use case keywords** - "qr code for restaurant menu", "qr code for business card"
5. **Problem/solution keywords** - "qr code not scanning", "qr code too small"
