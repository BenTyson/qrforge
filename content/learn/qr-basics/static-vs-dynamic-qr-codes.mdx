## Understanding the Difference

When creating a QR code, one of the most important decisions you'll make is choosing between **static** and **dynamic** QR codes. This choice impacts your flexibility, analytics capabilities, and long-term usability.

## Static QR Codes

Static QR codes encode data directly into the QR pattern itself. Once created, the information cannot be changed.

### How They Work

The destination URL or data is permanently encoded in the QR code's pattern. When scanned, the device reads this information directly from the code.

### Advantages

- **Free to create** - No ongoing subscription required
- **Work offline** - No server needed to redirect
- **Simple** - What you create is what you get
- **Permanent** - Will work as long as the destination exists

### Disadvantages

- **Cannot be edited** - Any change requires a new QR code
- **No analytics** - Cannot track scans
- **Larger patterns** - Long URLs create denser, harder-to-scan codes
- **No expiration control** - Cannot disable the code

### Best For

- Personal use
- Permanent information (like WiFi passwords)
- One-time events
- When analytics aren't needed

## Dynamic QR Codes

Dynamic QR codes redirect through a short URL that can be updated at any time. The QR code pattern encodes a short tracking URL, not the final destination.

### How They Work

1. QR code encodes a short URL (e.g., qrwolf.com/r/abc123)
2. User scans and is redirected through our servers
3. We record analytics and redirect to your destination
4. You can change the destination anytime

### Advantages

- **Editable** - Update destination without reprinting
- **Analytics** - Track scans, locations, devices, and times
- **Shorter URLs** - Cleaner, easier-to-scan patterns
- **Expiration control** - Set start and end dates
- **Password protection** - Secure sensitive content
- **A/B testing** - Test different destinations

### Disadvantages

- **Require subscription** - Ongoing service needed
- **Server dependent** - Need internet and service availability
- **Privacy considerations** - Scans are tracked

### Best For

- Marketing campaigns
- Business cards
- Product packaging
- Restaurant menus
- Any printed materials that might need updates

<Callout type="warning" title="Important Consideration">
Once you print materials with a QR code, you're committed to that code. If you use a static code and need to change the destination, you'll need to reprint everything. Dynamic codes eliminate this risk.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Static | Dynamic |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Edit destination | No | Yes |
| Scan analytics | No | Yes |
| Expiration dates | No | Yes |
| Password protection | No | Yes |
| Cost | Free | Subscription |
| Server dependency | No | Yes |
| Pattern complexity | Higher | Lower |

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Restaurant Menu

**Static QR Code Problem:**
You print 100 table tents with a QR code linking to your menu. Next month, you update your prices. Now all 100 table tents are outdated and need reprinting.

**Dynamic QR Code Solution:**
Simply update the destination URL in your QRWolf dashboard. All existing QR codes now point to your updated menu. Zero reprinting needed.

### Scenario 2: Product Packaging

**Static QR Code Problem:**
Your product packaging links to a support page. The support page URL changes during a website redesign. Thousands of products in stores now have broken QR codes.

**Dynamic QR Code Solution:**
Update the redirect URL once, and every product ever shipped continues to work perfectly.

### Scenario 3: Marketing Campaign

**Static QR Code Problem:**
You run a billboard campaign with QR codes. You have no idea how many people scanned them or from where.

**Dynamic QR Code Solution:**
Track every scan with detailed analytics: location, time, device type, and more. Measure your campaign's true ROI.

## Making the Right Choice

### Choose Static When:
- Creating personal QR codes
- The destination will never change
- You don't need analytics
- Budget is the primary concern

### Choose Dynamic When:
- Using QR codes for business
- Information might need updates
- You want to track engagement
- Planning marketing campaigns
- Printing on permanent materials

<Callout type="tip" title="Our Recommendation">
For any business use, we strongly recommend dynamic QR codes. The small investment pays for itself the first time you need to update a destination without reprinting materials.
