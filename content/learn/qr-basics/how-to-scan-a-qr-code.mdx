## When QR Codes Won't Scan

### Problem: "Unsafe Link" Warning

## QR Scanning Tips

### For Best Results

1. **Hold steady** - Don't move while scanning
2. **Good lighting** - Avoid shadows on the code
3. **Correct distance** - Usually 6-12 inches
4. **Straight angle** - Point directly at the code
5. **Clean lens** - Wipe your camera lens

### What QR Codes Can Do

When you scan a QR code, it might:

| Action | What Happens |
|--------|--------------|
| Open URL | Takes you to a website |
| WiFi connect | Prompts to join network |
| Save contact | Opens contacts with pre-filled info |
| Make call | Dials a phone number |
| Send SMS | Opens messaging app |
| Add event | Creates calendar entry |
| Show text | Displays plain text |
| Open app | Launches specific app |

## Third-Party QR Scanner Apps

While built-in scanning works for most people, dedicated apps offer extra features:

**Reasons to use a third-party app:**
- Scan history
- Create QR codes
- Batch scanning
- Offline scanning

**Popular options:**
- QR Code Reader by Scan
- QR & Barcode Scanner
- NeoReader

**However:** Be cautious with third-party apps. Some contain ads or request unnecessary permissions. The built-in scanner is safest for most users.

## Accessibility Features

### For Low Vision Users

**iPhone:**
- VoiceOver reads QR code contents aloud
- Magnifier app can help with small codes

**Android:**
- TalkBack announces QR code detection
- Magnification can enlarge the camera view

### For Motor Difficulties

Many phones support voice commands:
- "Hey Siri, scan QR code"
- "Hey Google, scan QR code"

## Scanning in Different Situations

### QR Codes on TV/Computer Screens

- Avoid scanning directly under bright lights
- Reduce screen brightness if there's glare
- Move your phone closer than usual

### Small QR Codes

- Use your camera's zoom (pinch to zoom)
- Get as close as possible while staying in focus
- Ensure good lighting

### QR Codes Behind Glass

- Angle your phone to avoid reflections
- Move to reduce glare
- Turn off your phone's flash

### Worn or Faded QR Codes

- QR codes have error correction—try anyway
- Improve lighting
- Try different angles

## Why Scanning Matters

QR codes connect the physical and digital worlds instantly:

- **Restaurant menus** - No touching shared menus
- **Payments** - Quick and contactless
- **Information** - Instant access to details
- **Networking** - Save contacts immediately
- **Marketing** - Bridge print and digital

Understanding how to scan opens up all these possibilities.

## Summary

**iPhone:** Open Camera → Point at code → Tap notification

**Android:** Open Camera → Point at code → Tap link (or use Google Lens)

No apps needed. If built-in scanning doesn't work, check your camera settings or try Google Lens.
