The most common reason QR codes fail to scan isn't damage or poor design—it's **size**. A QR code that's too small for its intended scanning distance becomes unreadable, no matter how perfect everything else is.

## The Golden Rule: 10:1 Ratio

Here's the fundamental principle: **the scanning distance should be roughly 10 times the QR code's width**.

| QR Code Size | Optimal Scanning Distance |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| 2 cm (0.8 in) | 20 cm (8 in) |
| 5 cm (2 in) | 50 cm (20 in) |
| 10 cm (4 in) | 1 meter (3.3 ft) |
| 30 cm (12 in) | 3 meters (10 ft) |
| 1 meter (3.3 ft) | 10 meters (33 ft) |

This ratio accounts for average camera quality and lighting conditions. In poor lighting or with lower-quality cameras, increase the size by 25-50%.

Divide your expected scanning distance by 10 to get the minimum QR code width. Then add 20% as a safety margin.

## Absolute Minimum Sizes

Regardless of scanning distance, QR codes have absolute minimums based on printing technology and scanner capability:

### Digital Screens
- **Minimum**: 2 cm × 2 cm (72+ pixels)
- Works for phones held close to screen
- Increase for tablets and monitors viewed from further away

### Standard Printing (300 DPI)
- **Minimum**: 2 cm × 2 cm (about 0.8 inches)
- Each module (tiny square) must be at least 0.3mm
- Lower quality printers may need larger sizes

### Large Format Printing
- **Minimum module size**: 6mm for outdoor viewing
- Weather and distance both factor in
- Always test with actual materials before mass production

## Sizing by Application

### Business Cards
**Recommended**: 2-2.5 cm (0.8-1 inch)

Business cards are viewed at arm's length or closer. A 2cm QR code leaves room for other content while remaining scannable. Don't go smaller than 1.5cm even on premium card stock.

### Flyers and Brochures
**Recommended**: 3-4 cm (1.2-1.6 inches)

These materials are often viewed on tables or held at reading distance. Larger sizes also catch the eye better, encouraging scans.

### Posters and Signage
**Recommended**: Calculate based on viewing distance

For a poster viewed from 2 meters away:
- Minimum: 20 cm (8 inches)
- Recommended: 25 cm (10 inches)

<Callout type="warning" title="Common Mistake">
Don't assume everyone will walk up close to scan your poster. Size for the distance where people first notice and decide to interact.

### Product Packaging

| Package Type | Recommended Size |
|--------------|------------------|
| Small boxes (cosmetics, electronics) | 1.5-2 cm |
| Medium boxes (food, household) | 2-3 cm |
| Large boxes (appliances) | 3-5 cm |
| Bottles and jars | 1.5-2.5 cm |

Consider the curved surface of bottles—QR codes may need to be larger to compensate for distortion.

### Restaurant Table Tents
**Recommended**: 4-5 cm (1.6-2 inches)

Diners scan from a seated position, roughly 50cm away. Account for low lighting in many restaurant environments by using high-contrast colors.

### Billboards and Outdoor Advertising
**Recommended**: 30+ cm minimum, often 50-100 cm

These require special consideration:
- Scanning from vehicles is unsafe and impractical
- Pedestrians might be 5-10 meters away
- Use QR codes only in pedestrian-friendly locations
- Consider shortened URLs as alternatives for drive-by visibility

## Data Density Affects Size

QR codes with more data have more modules (the tiny squares), which means each module is smaller at the same overall size. This directly impacts scannability.

| Content Type | Approximate Characters | Minimum Size at 300 DPI |
|--------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Short URL | 20-30 | 2 cm |
| Long URL with tracking | 50-100 | 2.5 cm |
| vCard | 150-300 | 3 cm |
| WiFi credentials | 50-80 | 2 cm |
| Paragraph of text | 500+ | 4+ cm |

<Callout type="info" title="Pro Tip">
Use URL shorteners or [dynamic QR codes](/learn/static-vs-dynamic-qr-codes) to reduce data density. A shorter URL means fewer modules and more reliable scanning at smaller sizes.

## Error Correction and Size

Higher [error correction levels](/learn/qr-code-error-correction) add redundancy but also increase the number of modules:

- **Level L (7%)**: Smallest possible size
- **Level M (15%)**: Good balance, recommended for most uses
- **Level Q (25%)**: Better for printed materials
- **Level H (30%)**: Required if adding logos, increases size by ~25%

If you're adding a logo to your QR code, you need Level H error correction, which means the code needs to be proportionally larger.

## Testing Your QR Codes

Before printing at scale, always test:

1. **Print a sample** at actual size on the actual material
2. **Test with multiple devices** (old phones, new phones, tablets)
3. **Test in realistic lighting** (not just your well-lit office)
4. **Test at intended distance** and a bit further
5. **Test the actual scan flow** to ensure the landing page works

### Quick Test Checklist

- [ ] Scans on iPhone (older model)
- [ ] Scans on Android (budget model if possible)
- [ ] Scans at minimum expected distance
- [ ] Scans at maximum expected distance
- [ ] Scans in low light
- [ ] Scans under fluorescent lighting
- [ ] Landing page loads correctly on mobile

## Quiet Zone Requirements

Every QR code needs a **quiet zone**—blank space around the code that helps scanners identify where the code begins and ends.

**Minimum quiet zone**: 4 modules wide on all sides

For a QR code with 1mm modules, that's 4mm of blank space. This is non-negotiable; QR codes placed too close to other design elements or edges will fail to scan.

## Resolution for Digital Use

When creating QR codes for screens or digital distribution:

| Use Case | Minimum Resolution |
|----------|-------------------|
| Social media | 500 × 500 px |
| Website display | 300 × 300 px |
| Email signatures | 150 × 150 px |
| Print at 300 DPI | Vector (SVG) preferred |

Always export at higher resolution than you think you need. Scaling up low-resolution QR codes causes scanning failures.

## Summary: Size Guidelines

| Application | Minimum Size | Recommended |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| Business card | 1.5 cm | 2 cm |
| Flyer/brochure | 2.5 cm | 3.5 cm |
| Poster (indoor) | 10 cm | 15 cm |
| Table tent | 3 cm | 4.5 cm |
| Product packaging | 1.5 cm | 2.5 cm |
| Banner/signage | 20 cm | 30 cm |

When in doubt, go bigger. An oversized QR code is slightly less elegant but always works. An undersized QR code is useless.

## Create Perfectly Sized QR Codes

QRWolf generates QR codes in vector format (SVG), which means you can scale them to any size without quality loss. [Create your QR code](/signup) and download in SVG for print or PNG for digital use—both at publication-ready quality.
