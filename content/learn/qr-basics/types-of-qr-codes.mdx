When most people think of QR codes, they imagine a simple link to a website. But QR codes can encode far more than URLs—they can connect to WiFi networks, share contact information, open social media profiles, display restaurant menus, add calendar events, show map locations, and much more. The type of content you encode determines what happens when someone scans your code.

Understanding the available content types helps you choose the right one for your specific use case. A real estate agent sharing property listings has different needs than a restaurant replacing paper menus, and both differ from a musician promoting their Spotify profile. This guide covers all 34 content types available on QRWolf, explaining when and why to use each.

## Basic Content Types

These fundamental types cover the most common QR code use cases. They encode content directly into the code or link to simple destinations.

### URL

The most common QR code type links to a web address. When scanned, the user's browser opens the specified URL—whether that's your homepage, a product page, a landing page, or any other web destination.

URL codes work for virtually any web-based content: marketing campaigns, product information, event registration, or app downloads. The versatility makes URL codes the default choice when other specialized types don't apply.

For dynamic URL codes, you can change the destination after printing. This proves invaluable when campaigns evolve, pages move, or you discover a typo in your original link.

### Text

Text QR codes encode plain text that displays on the scanner's screen. No internet connection required—the text is stored directly in the code itself.

Common uses include short messages, instructions, serial numbers, or any information that doesn't need to link elsewhere. A manufacturer might encode model numbers and specifications. A museum might encode artwork descriptions for offline viewing. An escape room might encode puzzle clues.

Text codes have capacity limits. Simple QR codes hold a few hundred characters comfortably; very long text requires larger codes that may be harder to scan.

### WiFi

WiFi QR codes encode network credentials—network name (SSID), password, and security type—in a format that smartphones recognize. Scanning the code prompts the user to join the network automatically, eliminating the need to type passwords manually.

These codes transform guest WiFi from an awkward exchange ("the password is capital X, lowercase q, number 7...") into a simple scan. Homes, offices, cafes, hotels, and any space with visitor WiFi benefit from prominently displayed WiFi codes.

### vCard (Contact Card)

vCard codes encode contact information in a standardized format that phone address books understand. Scanning adds the contact directly—no manual entry of names, numbers, emails, or addresses.

Business professionals use vCard codes on business cards, email signatures, and conference badges. The code replaces the ritual of exchanging paper cards that get lost or manually entered with typos. One scan captures complete contact information accurately.

vCard supports extensive fields: name, organization, title, multiple phone numbers, multiple email addresses, physical address, website, and notes.

### Email

Email QR codes open the user's email app with a new message pre-addressed to your specified recipient. You can also pre-fill the subject line and body text, reducing friction for specific inquiries.

Customer service teams use email codes to route inquiries to the right address with context already included. Feedback stations use them to streamline survey responses. Conference organizers use them to facilitate speaker follow-ups.

### Phone

Phone QR codes initiate a phone call to a specified number when scanned. The user's phone opens the dialer with the number ready—one tap to connect.

Businesses display phone codes wherever customers might need to call: storefronts, product packaging, service vehicles, and advertisements. The code eliminates the friction of reading a phone number and typing it correctly.

### SMS

SMS QR codes open the messaging app with a recipient number and optional pre-written message. The user can send as-is or edit before sending.

Text-to-vote campaigns, customer feedback collection, and appointment reminders often use SMS codes. A restaurant might post a code that opens a message reading "RESERVE" to their booking number.

## Social Media Types

These types optimize the connection between physical materials and social platforms. Each creates a direct link to your profile on the respective platform, making it effortless for people to follow or connect with you.

### WhatsApp

WhatsApp QR codes open a chat with your specified phone number in the WhatsApp app. The user lands in a conversation ready to send a message—no need to add you as a contact first.

Businesses using WhatsApp for customer communication display these codes on packaging, receipts, and marketing materials. You can include a pre-filled message that appears when the chat opens.

### Instagram

Instagram QR codes link directly to your Instagram profile, making it easy for people to follow you from physical marketing materials.

Particularly valuable for visual brands, creators, and businesses where Instagram serves as a portfolio or primary engagement channel. Restaurant table tents, product packaging, and event materials commonly feature Instagram codes.

### Facebook

Facebook QR codes link to your Facebook page or profile. Scanning takes users directly to your Facebook presence where they can like, follow, or message.

Retail locations, event venues, and local businesses use Facebook codes to grow their following from physical touchpoints.

LinkedIn QR codes connect to your professional profile. Ideal for networking events, conference badges, business cards, and professional materials where you want to facilitate B2B connections.

Scanning takes users directly to your LinkedIn profile where they can connect, view your experience, and reach out professionally.

### X (Twitter)

X QR codes link to your X profile. Perfect for growing your following from physical materials, event signage, or anywhere you want to bridge offline presence with your X audience.

### TikTok

TikTok QR codes link to your TikTok profile. Essential for creators and brands building presence on the platform, especially when promoting your TikTok content through physical materials or other channels.

<ArticleCTA qrType="tiktok" />

### YouTube

YouTube QR codes can link to your channel, a specific video, or a playlist. Ideal for content creators, educators, and businesses using video marketing.

Print materials promoting video content—tutorials, product demos, music videos, or educational series—benefit from direct YouTube links that skip the search process.

### Snapchat

Snapchat QR codes make it easy for people to add you on Snapchat. The code opens directly to your profile in the Snapchat app.

### Threads

Threads QR codes link to your Threads profile, Meta's text-based conversation platform. Useful for creators and brands building presence on the platform.

### Pinterest

Pinterest QR codes link to your Pinterest profile or specific boards. Valuable for brands, designers, and creators whose visual content thrives on Pinterest's discovery-focused platform.

### Spotify

Spotify QR codes link to your artist profile, a specific album, playlist, or podcast. Musicians, podcasters, and curators use these to promote their audio content from physical materials.

Album artwork, concert posters, podcast promotional materials, and music venue signage all benefit from direct Spotify links.

<ArticleCTA qrType="spotify" />

### Reddit

Reddit QR codes link to your profile or a specific subreddit. Useful for community managers, brands with active Reddit presence, or anyone wanting to direct people to Reddit discussions.

### Twitch

Twitch QR codes link to your Twitch channel. Streamers promote their channels through physical materials at gaming events, conventions, or anywhere they want to convert real-world encounters into followers.

### Discord

Discord QR codes share server invite links. Gaming communities, brand communities, educational groups, and any Discord server can use these to simplify joining from physical promotional materials.

<ArticleCTA qrType="discord" />

### App Download

App QR codes handle the complexity of multi-platform app distribution. When scanned, they detect the user's device and direct to the appropriate app store—Apple App Store for iPhones, Google Play for Android devices.

This smart redirect eliminates the awkward choice between printing two codes or sending users to a platform-agnostic landing page. One code serves all users regardless of their device.

## Events & Location Types

These types help people find places and add events to their calendars—perfect for invitations, venue signage, and location-based marketing.

### Event / Calendar

Event QR codes create calendar entries that users can add to their phone's calendar app. The code encodes event details including title, date, time, location, and description.

Wedding invitations, conference sessions, appointment reminders, and recurring meetings all benefit from scannable calendar events. One scan adds the event with all details—no manual entry required.

<ArticleCTA qrType="event" />

### Location / Geo

Location QR codes encode GPS coordinates or addresses that open in the user's maps app. Scanning shows the location and offers directions.

Businesses share their location for easy navigation. Event venues help attendees find the right building. Real estate agents direct buyers to property locations. Any scenario where "here's where to go" matters benefits from location codes.

## Reviews

### Google Review

Google Review QR codes link directly to your Google Business review page, making it effortless for satisfied customers to leave feedback.

Restaurants, retail stores, service businesses, and any company wanting more Google reviews display these codes at checkout, on receipts, or in follow-up materials. Removing friction dramatically increases review completion rates.

## File & Media Types

These types go beyond simple links, hosting files and creating rich media experiences. Available on Pro and Business tiers.

### PDF

PDF QR codes link to hosted documents—manuals, brochures, menus, flyers, or any PDF file. Scanning opens the document in a viewer where users can read, scroll, and download.

The document lives online and can be updated without changing the QR code. A product manual code printed on packaging can link to the current version even as the manual is revised.

<ArticleCTA qrType="pdf" />

### Image Gallery

Image gallery QR codes link to a collection of photos displayed in an attractive viewer. Users can browse, zoom, and swipe through your curated gallery.

Real estate agents use galleries for property photos. Event organizers share photo collections. Product companies show items from multiple angles. Artists create portable portfolios.

<ArticleCTA qrType="images" />

### Video

Video QR codes link to video content with an optimized viewing experience. The landing page can embed YouTube, Vimeo, or directly hosted video files with branded presentation.

Product demonstrations, how-to guides, promotional videos, and event recordings all work well. Analytics track who actually watched.

<ArticleCTA qrType="video" />

### Audio / MP3

Audio QR codes connect to music, podcasts, or other audio content. The landing page provides playback controls and can embed content from various sources.

Musicians sharing their work, podcasters promoting episodes, audiobook authors providing samples, and tour guides offering audio companions all benefit from audio codes.

## Landing Page Types

These advanced types create complete branded experiences rather than simple redirects. They're designed for specific use cases where a full landing page serves users better than a basic link.

### Restaurant Menu

Menu QR codes create digital restaurant menus with categories, items, descriptions, and prices. The resulting page is designed specifically for the dining experience—easy to browse on a phone, visually organized, and updateable without reprinting.

Menus can update instantly when items sell out or prices change. Photos can accompany items. Allergen information can be included without cluttering the layout.

<ArticleCTA qrType="menu" />

### Digital Business Card

Digital business card QR codes create a branded landing page with your professional information, social links, and contact details. Visitors can tap to call, tap to email, or download your full contact information as a vCard.

More impressive than a plain vCard code, digital business cards provide visual branding and are editable—change jobs and you update the card, not reprint it.

<ArticleCTA qrType="business" />

### Link List

Links QR codes create a page with multiple clickable links—similar to Linktree or other "link in bio" services. Perfect when you want to offer several destinations from a single code.

A musician might link to Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, merch store, and tour dates from one code on their poster. A brand might offer product pages, social profiles, and contact options.

<ArticleCTA qrType="links" />

### Coupon

Coupon QR codes create promotional offer pages with discount codes, terms, and expiration dates. The page displays the offer attractively and makes the code easy to copy or show at checkout.

Retail promotions, restaurant specials, and service discounts all work well. The scannable coupon can include images, detailed terms, and restrictions.

<ArticleCTA qrType="coupon" />

### Social Profile Hub

Social profile QR codes create a branded hub for all your social media presence. The page displays links to every platform where you're active.

Influencers, creators, and brands with presence across multiple platforms use social codes to let followers choose their preferred way to connect. Rather than deciding between Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube codes, one code covers everything.

## Choosing the Right Type

Selecting the appropriate QR code type depends on what you want to happen after the scan:

**What action should the user take?** If they should visit a website, use URL. If they should save your contact, use vCard. If they should connect to WiFi, use WiFi. If they should follow you on Instagram, use Instagram. Match the type to the desired outcome.

**Does the content need to change?** If you might update the destination, use dynamic codes. PDF, video, and landing page types are inherently dynamic—the content can change while the code stays the same.

**What device features do you need?** Phone and SMS codes use the dialer and messaging. WiFi codes use network settings. Event codes use the calendar. Consider what capabilities the scan should trigger.

**How much information are you sharing?** Simple links need URL codes. Rich experiences need landing page types. Multiple options need Links codes. Match complexity to the type's capabilities.
