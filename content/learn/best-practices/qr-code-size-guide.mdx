A QR code that's too small won't scan reliably. A code that's too large wastes valuable space on your materials. Getting the size right requires understanding the relationship between the code itself, the scanning distance, and the context where it will appear.

This guide provides practical sizing guidelines for every common application, from business cards to billboards, with the reasoning behind each recommendation so you can make informed decisions for unusual situations.

## The Fundamental Rule: Scan Distance Determines Size

QR code sizing isn't arbitrary. It follows a simple physical principle: the farther away someone will scan from, the larger the code needs to be. Phone cameras can only resolve so much detail at a given distance, and QR codes must be large enough for individual modules (those black and white squares) to be clearly distinguishable.

The standard rule of thumb is that a QR code should be at least one-tenth the scanning distance. If someone will scan from 30 centimeters away (about arm's length, typical for handheld materials), the code should be at least 3 centimeters per side. If someone will scan from 3 meters away (across a room, typical for wall signage), the code needs to be at least 30 centimeters per side.

This 10:1 ratio provides a comfortable margin. Codes can technically be smaller and still work, but you're gambling on perfect conditions—good lighting, steady hands, newer phones with better cameras. The 10:1 ratio works reliably across device generations, lighting conditions, and user skill levels.

<Callout type="tip" title="The 10:1 Rule">
Divide expected scanning distance by 10 to get minimum QR code size. Scanning from 50cm away? Code should be at least 5cm. Scanning from 2 meters? At least 20cm.

## Minimum Size: The 2cm Floor

Regardless of how close someone might scan, QR codes smaller than 2 centimeters (about 0.8 inches) become problematic. Below this threshold, the modules themselves become difficult for cameras to resolve clearly, and minor printing imperfections can render codes unscannable.

For any printed application, treat 2cm × 2cm as the absolute minimum. This size works for close-range scanning on materials people hold in their hands—product tags, receipts, tickets. It doesn't provide much margin for error, so only use this minimum when space is genuinely constrained.

For digital displays, the calculation changes somewhat. Screen resolution and pixel density matter more than physical size. A QR code needs enough pixels for each module to be clearly rendered. Generally, allow at least 3 pixels per module at minimum, with 4-5 pixels per module preferred for reliable scanning across devices.

## Size Recommendations by Application

### Business Cards (2-2.5cm)

Business cards force the tightest size constraints. Standard cards (85mm × 55mm or 3.5" × 2") have limited real estate, and QR codes must compete with contact information, logos, and design elements.

A 2cm × 2cm code fits comfortably on most business card layouts while remaining scannable. At this size, the code works when held at normal viewing distance (roughly arm's length). Going smaller risks scanning failures; going larger dominates the card visually.

Position the code away from trim edges—printers have tolerances, and a code cut partially off is useless. Leave at least 3mm of clear space (called the quiet zone) around the code on all sides. Dark codes on light backgrounds scan most reliably, though reasonable contrast in brand colors can work.

### Product Labels and Packaging (2-3cm)

Product packaging offers more flexibility than business cards but still involves size constraints. Small products—cosmetics, food items, electronics accessories—might only accommodate a 2cm code. Larger packaging can support 3cm or bigger codes, which improves scanning reliability.

Consider where the code appears on the package and how customers will encounter it. A code on the bottom of a box might be scanned from directly above, allowing smaller sizes. A code on a shelf-facing panel might be scanned at an angle from a couple feet away, requiring larger sizing.

Curved surfaces introduce scanning challenges that larger codes help overcome. A QR code wrapped around a bottle scans more reliably at 3cm than at 2cm because the distortion affects a smaller percentage of the code's total modules.

### Flyers and Brochures (2.5-4cm)

Marketing materials intended for handheld viewing—flyers, brochures, product sheets—typically accommodate QR codes in the 2.5-4cm range comfortably. This size ensures reliable scanning while leaving ample space for your actual content.

The extra room compared to business cards improves reliability and allows for logo integration. A 3cm code with your logo in the center scans well while reinforcing brand recognition. Smaller codes with logos become risky because the logo consumes space that would otherwise help with error correction.

### Posters and Wall Signage (5-10cm minimum)

Wall-mounted materials change the scanning equation significantly. People won't press their phones against a poster; they'll scan from a comfortable standing distance, typically 30-100 centimeters away.

For standard posters (A3, tabloid size) mounted at eye level, QR codes should be at least 5cm square. This accommodates scanning from arm's length to about a meter away. Larger posters—A2, A1, or bigger—can and should increase code size proportionally.

Museum plaques, informational signage, and wayfinding applications often benefit from codes in the 7-10cm range. The larger size signals "scan me" visually and ensures visitors can capture the code without awkward phone positioning.

### Billboards and Large-Format Signage (30cm minimum)

Large-scale outdoor applications require dramatically larger codes. A billboard visible from 30 meters away needs a QR code at least 3 meters (about 10 feet) across to scan reliably. In practice, this makes QR codes on traditional billboards impractical—the space they'd consume outweighs their utility.

However, QR codes work well on large signage at closer viewing distances. A code on a transit shelter ad (scanning distance 2-3 meters) should be 20-30cm. A code on a trade show banner (scanning distance 1-2 meters) should be 10-20cm. A code on a building entrance sign (scanning distance 3-5 meters) might need 30-50cm.

Vehicle wraps and transit advertising fall somewhere in between. Consider the most likely scanning scenario—someone waiting at a stop, walking past, or stuck in traffic—and size accordingly.

QR codes on highway billboards rarely work. Drivers can't safely scan while moving, and passengers would need codes measured in meters to scan from a passing vehicle. Focus QR codes where people can actually use them.

### Table Tents and Point-of-Sale (3-5cm)

Restaurant table tents, checkout displays, and counter cards occupy a middle ground. People encounter these from close range but often at angles (looking down at a table tent) that complicate scanning.

A 3-4cm code on a table tent scans reliably from typical seated positions. Checkout counter codes should be similarly sized, positioned where customers naturally look while waiting. Point-of-purchase displays benefit from slightly larger codes (4-5cm) since customers might scan from a step or two back while browsing.

### Presentations and Slides (Context Dependent)

QR codes in presentations face unique challenges: the size depends entirely on the projection environment. A code that fills half a slide scans fine in a small meeting room but becomes problematic in a large auditorium.

The safest approach is to make presentation QR codes as large as your design allows, then test in the actual or similar venue. If that's impossible, err toward larger. A code that seems oversized on your laptop screen might be just right when projected in a conference room.

Consider alternatives for large venues: display the code for an extended time, provide printed cards with the code at seats, or share the URL in chat for virtual participants.

## Factors That Affect Required Size

Several variables beyond distance influence whether a QR code scans reliably at a given size.

**Data density** affects minimum size. QR codes that contain more data have more modules packed into the same space, making each module smaller. A code pointing to a short URL might scan at 2cm, but a code containing a lengthy vCard might need 3cm for the same reliability. Dynamic QR codes help here because they encode short redirect URLs regardless of how long your final destination is.

**Error correction level** trades capacity for reliability. Higher error correction allows codes to scan even when partially obscured or damaged, but it also increases module density. For print applications with potential wear and tear, higher error correction (and correspondingly larger size) makes sense.

**Print quality** matters enormously. High-resolution printing on quality paper produces crisp module edges that cameras resolve easily. Newspaper printing, rubber stamps, or low-quality inkjet output creates fuzzy edges that require larger codes to scan reliably. When print quality is uncertain, increase size as a buffer.

**Surface finish** affects scanning. Glossy surfaces can create reflections that interfere with camera focus. Textured surfaces can distort the code. For challenging surfaces, increase size by 25-50% as insurance.

**Lighting conditions** at the scanning location matter. Well-lit environments allow smaller codes. Dim venues—restaurants, nightclubs, outdoor evening events—benefit from larger codes. If lighting is unpredictable or poor, size up.

## Testing Before Production

No amount of theory replaces actual testing. Before committing to a large print run or permanent signage, test your QR code at final size and in realistic conditions.

Print a proof at actual size on materials similar to final production. Test with multiple phones—an iPhone, a recent Android, an older device. Test in lighting conditions similar to where the code will appear. Test at angles customers might actually scan from. Test after the print has been handled, folded, or exposed to conditions it will face in deployment.

If the code scans easily and quickly across all tests, you're sized appropriately. If scanning requires careful positioning, steady hands, or multiple attempts, increase the size before production.

## Quick Reference Chart

| Application | Minimum Size | Recommended | Scan Distance |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| Business cards | 2cm | 2-2.5cm | 15-30cm |
| Product tags | 2cm | 2-2.5cm | 15-30cm |
| Product packaging | 2cm | 2.5-3cm | 20-40cm |
| Receipts/tickets | 2cm | 2.5cm | 15-30cm |
| Flyers/brochures | 2.5cm | 3-4cm | 20-50cm |
| Table tents | 3cm | 4cm | 30-60cm |
| Countertop displays | 3cm | 4-5cm | 30-75cm |
| Wall posters | 5cm | 7-10cm | 50-100cm |
| Large posters (A1+) | 7cm | 10-15cm | 75-150cm |
| Trade show banners | 10cm | 15-20cm | 100-200cm |
| Building signage | 20cm | 30-50cm | 200-500cm |

These recommendations assume average conditions. Increase sizes for challenging environments, lower print quality, or high data density.

## Getting the Size Right

Proper QR code sizing ensures your codes work reliably in real-world conditions. Too small, and you'll frustrate users with scanning failures. Too large, and you waste space that could serve other purposes.

Apply the 10:1 rule as your starting framework, adjust for the specific factors in your application, and always test before committing to production quantities. When in doubt, size up—a code that's larger than strictly necessary still works, while a code that's too small fails entirely.
