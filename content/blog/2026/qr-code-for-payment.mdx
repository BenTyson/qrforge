The shift toward contactless payments accelerated dramatically in recent years, and QR codes have emerged as one of the simplest ways to accept money without specialized hardware. A customer scans your code, confirms the amount on their phone, and the payment completes—no card reader, no cash handling, no typing account numbers into apps.

For small businesses, freelancers, and anyone who occasionally needs to collect payments, QR codes remove the friction that kills sales. The farmer at the market, the food truck operator, the contractor finishing a job—none of these need expensive point-of-sale systems when a printed QR code accomplishes the same thing with zero transaction fees from the code itself.

## How Payment QR Codes Work

Payment QR codes don't process transactions directly. Instead, they encode information that opens a payment app on the customer's phone with your details pre-filled. The actual transaction happens through whatever payment platform you've chosen—PayPal, Venmo, Cash App, or others. The QR code just eliminates the manual steps of finding your username or entering your payment address.

This approach means you need an account with a payment service before creating a QR code. The code essentially becomes a shortcut to your existing payment profile. When someone scans it, their phone recognizes the format and offers to open the appropriate app (or prompts them to download it if they don't have it installed).

Different payment platforms use different QR code formats. PayPal has its own specification, Venmo has another, and cryptocurrency wallets use yet another standard. Some services like PayPal even let you specify the payment amount in advance, while others simply open your profile and let the payer enter the amount themselves.

The QR code itself is free to create and use. However, the payment platform you connect it to may charge transaction fees—typically 2-3% for business accounts. These fees come from the platform, not the QR code technology.

## PayPal QR Codes

PayPal offers the most mature QR code payment system for businesses in the United States and many other countries. Their QR codes work for both personal and business accounts, though business accounts get additional features like the ability to preset payment amounts.

To create a PayPal QR code, log into your PayPal account and navigate to the QR code section (found under "Tools" or by searching for "QR code" in the PayPal app). PayPal generates a code linked to your account that customers can scan with any QR reader—not just the PayPal app. When scanned, the code opens PayPal's payment page with your account as the recipient.

For businesses that want more control, PayPal.me links provide an alternative approach. Your PayPal.me link (like paypal.me/yourbusiness) can include a preset amount: paypal.me/yourbusiness/25 would open a payment page with $25 pre-filled. Creating a QR code from this URL gives you a payment code with the amount baked in—useful for fixed-price items or services.

The advantage of PayPal is ubiquity. Nearly everyone with a smartphone has at least heard of PayPal, and the app's install base means your QR code reaches the widest possible audience. The disadvantage is that PayPal's transaction fees for business accounts (around 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction) cut into margins on small payments.

## Venmo for Peer-to-Peer and Business

Venmo's QR codes work slightly differently, reflecting the platform's roots as a peer-to-peer payment app rather than a business payment processor. Every Venmo user has a scannable QR code in their profile that links directly to their payment screen.

To find your Venmo QR code, open the app, tap the QR icon at the top, and you'll see your personal code. You can screenshot this and print it, or share it digitally. When someone scans it with their phone camera or Venmo app, they're taken to a payment screen with your account selected.

Venmo business profiles offer additional features for merchants, including the ability to accept payments from customers who don't have Venmo (they can pay with a card through Venmo's interface). Business accounts pay transaction fees similar to PayPal, while personal accounts receiving payments from friends typically don't.

The social nature of Venmo—where transactions appear in a feed by default—may or may not suit your business. Many users leave payments public or to friends, which can provide word-of-mouth visibility but might feel odd for professional services. Adjusting privacy settings addresses this, but it's worth considering how Venmo's culture fits your brand.

## Cash App QR Codes

Cash App provides QR codes through its $cashtag system. Your $cashtag is your unique Cash App identifier (like $YourBusiness), and the app generates a QR code that links directly to it. Scanning this code opens Cash App to your payment profile.

Creating your Cash App QR code happens within the app itself. Tap your profile icon, then tap your $cashtag to see and share your QR code. The code can be saved as an image and printed like any other QR code.

Cash App has gained significant traction, particularly among younger users and in certain geographic markets. Its integration with Cash App Card (a physical debit card) and Bitcoin trading have expanded its appeal beyond simple payments. For businesses targeting demographics that prefer Cash App over PayPal or Venmo, having a Cash App QR code available makes sense.

Transaction fees for Cash App business accounts follow the industry standard of around 2.75% per transaction. Personal payments between friends remain free, but accepting payments for goods and services triggers the business fee.

## Creating Universal Payment QR Codes

If your customers use different payment apps, you have a few options beyond printing multiple QR codes for each platform.

One approach is creating a simple landing page that offers payment buttons for multiple services. Your QR code links to this page, and customers tap their preferred payment method. This adds one step to the payment process but accommodates everyone. Services like Linktree or a simple custom webpage can accomplish this, or you can use QRWolf's [Links QR code type](/qr-codes/new) to create a branded page with multiple payment options.

Another option is choosing the platform most common among your customers and accepting that some people will need to download a new app or pay another way. For most small businesses in the US, PayPal reaches the widest audience, but your specific customer base might lean differently.

Some point-of-sale systems now generate QR codes that accept multiple payment methods through their own processing. Square, Toast, and similar services offer this functionality, though you'll be paying their transaction fees rather than the underlying payment platform's fees.

Before printing payment QR codes, test them thoroughly. Have someone unfamiliar with your setup scan the code and complete a small payment. Watching someone else use it reveals friction you might not notice yourself.

## Cryptocurrency Payment QR Codes

Cryptocurrency payments use QR codes extensively because wallet addresses are long strings of characters that nobody wants to type manually. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrency wallets all generate QR codes containing your receiving address.

These QR codes follow standard formats that cryptocurrency wallet apps recognize. A Bitcoin QR code, for instance, uses the "bitcoin:" URI scheme followed by your wallet address and optionally an amount. When scanned, the payer's wallet app opens with the address pre-filled, ready to send.

For businesses accepting cryptocurrency, the volatility and transaction confirmation times present challenges that traditional payment QR codes don't face. A payment might be worth significantly more or less by the time it confirms on the blockchain. Services like BitPay and Coinbase Commerce help manage these issues by converting cryptocurrency to dollars immediately upon receipt.

The customer base for cryptocurrency payments remains relatively small compared to traditional payment apps, but for certain businesses—particularly those in tech, international trade, or privacy-focused markets—offering crypto payment options via QR code can be a differentiator.

## Printing and Displaying Payment QR Codes

Where and how you display your payment QR code affects how often people use it. The code needs to be visible at the moment of payment—obvious enough that customers notice it, positioned where they can comfortably scan it.

For retail environments, a small stand or frame at the checkout counter works well. The code should be at a comfortable height and angle for scanning—roughly waist to chest height, angled slightly toward the customer rather than flat on the counter. Poor positioning leads to awkward phone gymnastics that discourage use.

Size matters for scannability. A payment QR code displayed at point of sale typically works well at 2-3 inches square, assuming customers are within arm's reach. Larger displays for codes meant to be scanned from further away—on a wall or poster—should follow the general rule of about 1/10 the scanning distance (a code scanned from 5 feet away should be at least 6 inches).

Include clear instructions near the code. "Scan to Pay with PayPal" tells customers exactly what to expect. Without this context, some people may assume it links to a website or menu rather than a payment system. A small logo for the payment platform provides additional clarity.

## Security Considerations

Payment QR codes are relatively secure because the code itself doesn't contain payment credentials or sensitive data—it just links to your payment profile. The actual transaction security comes from the payment platform's systems, which include encryption, fraud detection, and buyer/seller protections.

The main risk with payment QR codes is substitution attacks, where someone places a fraudulent code over your legitimate one. In retail environments, physically check your displayed codes periodically to ensure they haven't been tampered with. Some businesses laminate or securely mount their codes to make replacement more difficult and obvious.

For dynamic payment amounts, the risk of someone modifying the requested amount exists but is mitigated by the fact that payers see and confirm the amount before completing the transaction. Still, train staff to verify that displayed amounts match expected totals when customers pay via QR code.

Keep records of payments received through QR codes just as you would any other transaction. The payment platforms provide transaction histories, but maintaining your own records helps with reconciliation and dispute resolution.

## Getting Started

Creating a payment QR code takes just a few minutes once you have your payment platform account set up. The platforms themselves provide built-in QR code generation, or you can create codes that link to your PayPal.me or similar payment URLs.

For a more polished approach—particularly if you want a code that matches your brand colors or includes your logo—[create a QR code with QRWolf](/qr-codes/new). Enter your PayPal.me link or other payment URL, customize the design to match your brand, and download a print-ready code. You can even create a [Links page](/qr-codes/new) with multiple payment options if your customers use different platforms.

The cost of creating and printing a payment QR code is essentially zero. The ongoing cost—transaction fees from your payment platform—is the same whether customers pay via QR code or any other method. What you gain is convenience that removes barriers to getting paid.
