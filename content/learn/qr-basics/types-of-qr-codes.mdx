When most people think of QR codes, they imagine a simple link to a website. But QR codes can encode far more than URLs—they can connect to WiFi networks, share contact information, trigger phone calls, display restaurant menus, and much more. The type of content you encode determines what happens when someone scans your code.

Understanding the available content types helps you choose the right one for your specific use case. A real estate agent sharing property listings has different needs than a restaurant replacing paper menus, and both differ from a conference organizer managing event check-ins. This guide covers all 16 content types, explaining when and why to use each.

## Basic Content Types

These fundamental types work on all tiers and cover the most common QR code use cases. They encode content directly into the code or link to simple destinations.

### URL

The most common QR code type links to a web address. When scanned, the user's browser opens the specified URL—whether that's your homepage, a product page, a landing page, or any other web destination.

URL codes work for virtually any web-based content: marketing campaigns, product information, event registration, social media profiles, or app downloads. The versatility makes URL codes the default choice when other specialized types don't apply.

For dynamic URL codes, you can change the destination after printing. This proves invaluable when campaigns evolve, pages move, or you discover a typo in your original link. Static URL codes encode the address directly and can't be modified—print carefully.

### Text

Text QR codes encode plain text that displays on the scanner's screen. No internet connection required—the text is stored directly in the code itself.

Common uses include short messages, instructions, serial numbers, or any information that doesn't need to link elsewhere. A manufacturer might encode model numbers and specifications. A museum might encode artwork descriptions for offline viewing. An escape room might encode puzzle clues.

Text codes have capacity limits. Simple QR codes hold a few hundred characters comfortably; very long text requires larger codes that may be harder to scan. For lengthy content, linking to a webpage often works better than encoding text directly.

### WiFi

WiFi QR codes encode network credentials—network name (SSID), password, and security type—in a format that smartphones recognize. Scanning the code prompts the user to join the network automatically, eliminating the need to type passwords manually.

These codes transform guest WiFi from an awkward exchange ("the password is capital X, lowercase q, number 7...") into a simple scan. Homes, offices, cafes, hotels, and any space with visitor WiFi benefit from prominently displayed WiFi codes.

The credentials are encoded directly in the code, so WiFi codes work offline. If you change your password, you'll need to generate and print a new code—the existing one will stop working.

### vCard

vCard codes encode contact information in a standardized format that phone address books understand. Scanning adds the contact directly—no manual entry of names, numbers, emails, or addresses.

Business professionals use vCard codes on business cards, email signatures, and conference badges. The code replaces the ritual of exchanging paper cards that get lost or manually entered with typos. One scan captures complete contact information accurately.

vCard supports extensive fields: name, organization, title, multiple phone numbers, multiple email addresses, physical address, website, and notes. You control which fields to include—a minimalist card might have just name and email, while a comprehensive one includes everything.

### Email

Email QR codes open the user's email app with a new message pre-addressed to your specified recipient. You can also pre-fill the subject line and body text, reducing friction for specific inquiries.

Customer service teams use email codes to route inquiries to the right address with context already included ("Subject: Question about Order #12345"). Feedback stations use them to streamline survey responses. Conference organizers use them to facilitate speaker follow-ups.

The mailto: URI scheme that email codes use is universally supported across devices and email apps. The recipient sees a composed message ready to send or customize before sending.

### Phone

Phone QR codes initiate a phone call to a specified number when scanned. The user's phone opens the dialer with the number ready—one tap to connect.

Businesses display phone codes wherever customers might need to call: storefronts, product packaging, service vehicles, and advertisements. The code eliminates the friction of reading a phone number and typing it correctly, especially for long or international numbers.

Like email codes, phone codes use a universal URI scheme (tel:) that works across all smartphones. The user always confirms before the call connects—scanning doesn't automatically dial.

### SMS

SMS QR codes open the messaging app with a recipient number and optional pre-written message. The user can send as-is or edit before sending.

Text-to-vote campaigns, customer feedback collection, and appointment reminders often use SMS codes. A restaurant might post a code that opens a message reading "RESERVE" to their booking number. A support line might pre-fill troubleshooting context.

SMS codes work reliably across devices since text messaging is a universal smartphone feature. Pre-filling the message reduces user effort and ensures consistent formatting for automated systems that process incoming texts.

## Social Media Types

These types optimize the connection between physical materials and social platforms, helping grow your audience and simplify engagement.

### WhatsApp

WhatsApp QR codes open a chat with your specified phone number in the WhatsApp app. The user lands in a conversation ready to send a message—no need to add you as a contact first.

Businesses using WhatsApp for customer communication display these codes on packaging, receipts, and marketing materials. The code bridges the gap between seeing a business and starting a conversation, reducing the friction that might otherwise prevent outreach.

You can include a pre-filled message that appears when the chat opens, prompting specific inquiries or providing conversation context.

### Facebook

Facebook QR codes link to your Facebook page or profile. Scanning takes users directly to your Facebook presence where they can like, follow, or message.

Retail locations, event venues, and local businesses use Facebook codes to grow their following from physical touchpoints. A code at the checkout counter catches customers while they're engaged with your brand.

### Instagram

Instagram QR codes link to your Instagram profile, making it easy for people to follow you from physical marketing materials.

Particularly valuable for visual brands, creators, and businesses where Instagram serves as a portfolio or primary engagement channel. Restaurant table tents, product packaging, and event materials commonly feature Instagram codes.

### Apps

App QR codes handle the complexity of multi-platform app distribution. When scanned, they detect the user's device and direct to the appropriate app store—Apple App Store for iPhones, Google Play for Android devices.

This smart redirect eliminates the awkward choice between printing two codes or sending users to a platform-agnostic landing page. One code serves all users regardless of their device.

## File & Media Types

These types go beyond simple links, hosting files and creating rich media experiences. Available on Pro and Business tiers.

### PDF

PDF QR codes link to hosted documents—manuals, brochures, menus, flyers, or any PDF file. Scanning opens the document in a viewer where users can read, scroll, and download.

The document lives online and can be updated without changing the QR code. A product manual code printed on packaging can link to the current version even as the manual is revised. Restaurant menus can update seasonally while the table tent stays the same.

### Images

Image gallery QR codes link to a collection of photos displayed in an attractive viewer. Users can browse, zoom, and swipe through your curated gallery.

Real estate agents use galleries for property photos. Event organizers share photo collections. Product companies show items from multiple angles. Artists create portable portfolios. The gallery format presents images better than simply linking to a folder.

### Video

Video QR codes link to video content with an optimized viewing experience. The landing page can embed YouTube, Vimeo, or directly hosted video files with branded presentation.

Product demonstrations, how-to guides, promotional videos, and event recordings all work well. The branded landing page provides a better experience than dumping users directly onto YouTube, and analytics track who actually watched.

### MP3 / Audio

Audio QR codes connect to music, podcasts, or other audio content. The landing page can embed Spotify, SoundCloud, or directly hosted audio files with playback controls.

Musicians sharing their work, podcasters promoting episodes, audiobook authors providing samples, and tour guides offering audio companions all benefit from audio codes. Like video, the branded experience improves on simply linking to a streaming platform.

## Landing Page Types

These advanced types create complete branded experiences rather than simple redirects. They're designed for specific use cases where a full landing page serves users better than a basic link.

### Menu

Menu QR codes create digital restaurant menus with categories, items, descriptions, and prices. The resulting page is designed specifically for the dining experience—easy to browse on a phone, visually organized, and updateable without reprinting.

Restaurants adopted these extensively as contactless alternatives to paper menus, but the benefits extend beyond hygiene. Menus can update instantly when items sell out or prices change. Photos can accompany items. Allergen information can be included without cluttering the layout.

### Business Card

Digital business card QR codes create a branded landing page with your professional information, social links, and contact details. Visitors can tap to call, tap to email, or download your full contact information as a vCard.

More impressive than a plain vCard code, digital business cards provide visual branding and social proof. They're also editable—change jobs and you update the card, not reprint it. The page can include a photo, logo, and company branding.

### Links

Links QR codes create a page with multiple clickable links—similar to Linktree or other "link in bio" services. Perfect when you want to offer several destinations from a single code.

Social media profiles, portfolios, product collections, and multi-location businesses use links pages to let users choose their path. A musician might link to Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, merch store, and tour dates from one code on their poster.

### Coupon

Coupon QR codes create promotional offer pages with discount codes, terms, and expiration dates. The page displays the offer attractively and makes the code easy to copy or show at checkout.

Retail promotions, restaurant specials, and service discounts all work well. The scannable coupon can include images, detailed terms, and restrictions—more information than fits on a physical coupon—while remaining easy to redeem.

### Social

Social profile QR codes create a branded hub for all your social media presence. The page displays your handle and links to every platform where you're active.

Influencers, creators, and brands with presence across multiple platforms use social codes to let followers choose their preferred way to connect. Rather than deciding between Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube codes, one code covers everything.

## Choosing the Right Type

Selecting the appropriate QR code type depends on what you want to happen after the scan. Consider these questions:

**What action should the user take?**
If they should visit a website, use URL. If they should save your contact, use vCard. If they should connect to WiFi, use WiFi. Match the type to the desired outcome.

**Does the content need to change?**
If you might update the destination, use dynamic codes with appropriate types. PDF, video, and landing page types are inherently dynamic—the content can change while the code stays the same.

**What device features do you need?**
Phone and SMS codes use the phone's dialer and messaging. WiFi codes use network settings. vCard codes use the contacts app. Consider what capabilities the scan should trigger.

**How much information are you sharing?**
Simple links need URL codes. Rich experiences need landing page types. Multiple options need Links codes. Match complexity to the type's capabilities.
