Creating a QR code takes less than a minute once you understand the basics. The process is essentially the same whether you need a code for your website, WiFi network, business card, or restaurant menu. You choose what type of information to encode, enter that information, optionally customize the appearance, and download the finished code.

This guide walks you through the entire process, from your first decision to your final download. By the end, you'll understand not just the mechanics of QR code creation, but the reasoning behind each choice so you can make codes that actually work for your specific situation.

## Preparing to Create Your QR Code

Before you start clicking buttons in a QR code generator, take a moment to think through what you're actually trying to accomplish. The choices you make at the beginning determine whether your QR code serves its purpose or becomes another piece of visual noise that nobody scans.

The first question is straightforward: what do you want to happen when someone scans your code? If you want them to visit a website, you need a URL QR code. If you want them to connect to your WiFi, you need a WiFi QR code. If you want them to save your contact information, you need a vCard QR code. The type determines what data the code contains and how scanning devices interpret that data.

The second question is subtler but equally important: will this information ever change? A restaurant menu changes seasonally. A marketing campaign URL might need updating based on performance data. Your office WiFi password should rotate periodically. If there's any chance the destination might change, you want a [dynamic QR code](/learn/static-vs-dynamic-qr-codes) that you can update without reprinting. If the information is truly permanent, a static code works fine.

That's genuinely all you need to decide beforehand. No special software, no technical skills, no design experience required. Just clarity on what you want the code to do and whether flexibility matters.

## Choosing the Right QR Code Type

QR codes aren't one-size-fits-all. Different types encode different kinds of data, and scanning devices interpret each type according to established standards. Choosing the wrong type means your code won't work as intended, no matter how pretty it looks.

The URL type is by far the most common, accounting for roughly half of all QR codes created. When scanned, it opens a web browser and navigates to the specified address. This versatility explains its popularity - a webpage can contain anything from a simple redirect to an elaborate interactive experience. If you're unsure which type to use, a URL pointing to a dedicated landing page is usually the safest choice.

WiFi codes have become essential for any business offering guest internet access. Rather than forcing visitors to ask for passwords or hunt for posted credentials, a WiFi QR code lets them scan and connect instantly. The code encodes the network name (SSID), password, and security type. When scanned, modern phones offer a one-tap connection option.

vCard codes transform business cards from static paper into interactive experiences. Scanning one prompts the phone to save a complete contact entry - name, phone numbers, email, company, job title, website, and even a photo. No more manually typing information from a card that will eventually get lost.

Text, email, phone, and SMS codes each trigger specific phone actions. A text code simply displays information on screen. An email code opens the email app with recipient, subject, and body pre-filled. A phone code initiates a call. An SMS code opens the messaging app with a pre-written text ready to send. Each serves a narrow but useful purpose.

## Entering Your Content

Once you've selected your QR code type, the generator asks for the specific content to encode. The details vary by type, but the principle is consistent: enter exactly what you want the code to contain.

For URL codes, enter the complete web address including the protocol. Start with `https://` rather than `http://` since most modern browsers flag non-secure connections. Double-check for typos - a single wrong character means your code points nowhere useful. If you're using UTM parameters for analytics tracking, include them in the URL: something like `https://yoursite.com/landing?utm_source=qr&utm_medium=print&utm_campaign=flyer`.

WiFi codes require three pieces of information. The network name must match exactly what appears in your phone's WiFi list, including capitalization and any spaces. The password is case-sensitive. The security type is usually WPA2 for modern networks, though some older systems use WPA or the now-insecure WEP. If you enter any of these incorrectly, the connection will fail when someone scans.

vCard codes accept a range of contact fields. At minimum, include your name and at least one contact method - phone or email. Beyond that, you can add company name, job title, mailing address, website URL, and additional phone numbers for work, home, or mobile. More fields mean more data encoded, which creates a denser QR code pattern. Include what's useful; skip what's redundant.

The remaining types have simpler requirements. Text codes accept any plain text up to the QR code's data capacity limits. Email codes need a recipient address and can optionally include a subject line and body text. Phone codes need a phone number in standard format. SMS codes need a phone number and the pre-written message text.

## Customizing Your QR Code's Appearance

The default black-and-white QR code works perfectly fine from a technical perspective. Every scanner can read it, every printing process can reproduce it, and nobody will be confused about what it is. But customization offers real benefits when done thoughtfully.

Brand recognition is the primary advantage. A QR code in your company colors, perhaps with your logo embedded in the center, reinforces your visual identity every time someone interacts with it. On marketing materials where brand consistency matters, a customized code looks intentional rather than like a generic afterthought.

Color customization follows one critical rule: maintain high contrast between the pattern (traditionally black) and the background (traditionally white). The pattern should be darker than the background. Inverting this relationship - light patterns on dark backgrounds - dramatically reduces scannability and confuses many readers. Beyond that constraint, you have flexibility. Dark blue patterns on cream backgrounds work. Forest green on white works. Just test thoroughly.

Adding a logo exploits a feature called error correction. QR codes intentionally include redundant data so they remain readable even when partially obscured or damaged. You can cover up to 30% of a code's area without affecting scannability. A centered logo claims some of that redundancy budget. Keep logos small - 15% to 25% of the code's dimensions - and use simple, high-contrast designs. Complex logos with fine details tend to interfere with nearby data modules.

## Downloading in the Right Format

QR codes come in different file formats, and the right choice depends on how you plan to use the code.

PNG files work for most digital applications and many print jobs. The format produces raster images - grids of pixels at a specific resolution. For web use, a 200x200 pixel PNG is usually sufficient. For print, you want higher resolution. The rule of thumb: 300 pixels per inch (PPI) at the printed size. If your code will print at 2 inches square, you need 600x600 pixels minimum. Larger is better for print; you can always scale down.

SVG files are vector graphics that scale infinitely without quality loss. They contain mathematical descriptions of shapes rather than pixel grids. For large-format printing - banners, billboards, vehicle wraps - SVG eliminates any worry about resolution. The trade-off is that some older print systems and basic image editors can't handle SVG files.

PDF files are essentially print-ready documents, useful when you need to send a code to a print shop or include it in a document workflow. Most PDFs from QR generators contain vector graphics internally, giving you the scalability benefits of SVG in a more universally compatible format.

For most situations, download both PNG (at the highest resolution available) and SVG. Use the PNG for quick digital sharing and the SVG for anything that might be printed at scale.

## Testing Before You Deploy

Never skip testing. A QR code that looked fine on your computer screen might fail when printed, displayed on a different screen, or scanned under real-world conditions. Finding out after you've printed 5,000 brochures is an expensive lesson.

Start by scanning with your phone's native camera app - both iPhone and Android have built-in QR scanners that represent what most users will use. Then try a dedicated scanning app or two, since some percentage of your audience will use these instead. If the code contains a URL, actually visit the destination and verify it works on mobile. Many websites that work fine on desktop have mobile issues that make the QR code experience frustrating.

Test under realistic conditions. If the code will be on a poster viewed from several feet away, print a test poster and scan it from that distance. If it'll be on a product package, test in the lighting conditions of a retail environment. If it'll be outdoors, test in direct sunlight where screen glare might affect the destination page's readability.

The testing checklist is simple: scan with iPhone camera, scan with Android camera, verify the destination works on mobile, test in the lighting and distance conditions where the code will actually live. Pass all four, and you're ready to deploy.

## Creating Specific QR Code Types

The general process applies to all QR codes, but each type has nuances worth understanding.

For URL codes, the biggest decision is whether to point directly to your destination or use an intermediate landing page. Direct links are simpler but inflexible - if you use a static code, changing the destination means reprinting everything. A [dynamic QR code](/learn/static-vs-dynamic-qr-codes) solves this by pointing to a redirect that you control, letting you change the ultimate destination anytime. If there's any chance you'll want to update where the code leads, go dynamic.

WiFi codes benefit from a dedicated guest network rather than sharing your primary network credentials. This limits security exposure if the code spreads beyond its intended audience. Create a guest network with a complex password - QR codes make long passwords painless since nobody has to type them.

vCard codes become most powerful as dynamic codes. Imagine printing 500 business cards, then getting a promotion that changes your title and phone number. With a static vCard, those 500 cards now share outdated information. With a dynamic vCard, you update your details once in the dashboard, and every card ever printed automatically shares the current version.

Menu codes for restaurants should always be dynamic. Prices change, items sell out, seasonal specials rotate. A dynamic menu code lets you update instantly from your phone if needed, while every printed table tent continues working with no changes required.

## Static Versus Dynamic: Making the Right Choice

This decision deserves emphasis because it's the most consequential choice in QR code creation, and many people make it without understanding the implications.

Static QR codes embed data directly into the code pattern. The information is literally encoded in those black and white modules. Change the information, and you need a completely new code. There's nothing to "update" - the code IS the data.

Dynamic QR codes take a different approach. They encode a short URL that points to a redirect server. When someone scans, they hit that server, which then forwards them to whatever destination you've configured. The code itself never changes; what changes is where that redirect points. This architecture enables changing destinations, tracking scan analytics, setting expiration dates, and adding password protection.

The practical implications are significant. A restaurant that prints static menu codes on 50 tables is stuck with that menu forever - or faces reprinting costs for every change. The same restaurant with dynamic codes updates their menu in 30 seconds from any device, and those same 50 printed codes now show the new menu.

Static codes make sense for genuinely permanent information: a text code with fixed instructions, a URL that will never change, a WiFi password that will remain constant for years. Everything else benefits from dynamic codes.

## Avoiding Common Mistakes

Experience reveals patterns in QR code failures. Most problems fall into a few categories.

Size matters more than people realize. A QR code needs enough physical size for camera sensors to resolve its individual modules. The minimum depends on scanning distance - codes viewed from arm's length can be smaller than codes viewed from across a room. For business cards scanned from inches away, 0.8 inches square is typically sufficient. For posters viewed from feet away, plan on at least 2 inches square, and bigger if people will scan from farther back.

Contrast failures doom many customized codes. That light gray on white might look elegant, but scanners struggle to differentiate the pattern from the background. High contrast isn't a suggestion; it's a requirement. When in doubt, stick with dark colors on light backgrounds.

Testing failures cause the most expensive problems. "It scanned fine on my phone" means nothing if it doesn't scan on half your customers' phones. Test on multiple devices, in realistic conditions, before committing to a print run.

Broken links make codes useless. If your URL changes and you used a static code, every printed code is now pointing to a 404 page or worse. Dynamic codes solve this entirely, but only if you remember to update the redirect when the destination changes.

Context matters more than the code itself. A bare QR code without any explanation asks users to take a leap of faith. "Scan for menu," "Connect to WiFi," or "Save my contact" tells people what they'll get, making them far more likely to actually scan.
