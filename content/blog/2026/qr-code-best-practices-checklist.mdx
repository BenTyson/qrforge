Most QR code failures come down to skipped steps. A designer exports the code at the wrong resolution. A marketer forgets to test before printing ten thousand brochures. A developer points the code to a page that doesn't exist on mobile. Each mistake is preventable with a simple checklist—yet businesses keep making them.

The following guide organizes everything that can go wrong with QR codes into checkable steps. Some items take seconds to verify. Others require planning before you start. All of them prevent the specific failures that waste materials, frustrate customers, and undermine campaigns. Print this out, bookmark it, or incorporate it into your workflow. The few minutes spent checking saves hours of fixing.

## Before Creating Your Code

The decisions you make before generating a QR code determine whether it succeeds or fails. Rushing past this planning phase causes the most expensive problems—the kind that require reprinting physical materials.

Define your destination before anything else. What URL will this code point to? Is that page live and working? Does it display correctly on mobile devices? A QR code is only as good as what it links to. The most beautifully designed code means nothing if it sends people to a broken page or a desktop-only site that's unusable on phones.

Choose dynamic over static for anything you might need to change later. If there's any possibility you'll want to update the destination, track scans, or extend the code's usefulness, pay the minimal extra for a dynamic code. Static codes bake the destination into the code itself—you cannot change it without generating a new code and reprinting.

Consider your audience's context. Where will they encounter this code? What device will they use? How much time do they have? A code on a highway billboard faces different constraints than one on a product manual. Understanding context shapes every subsequent decision about size, placement, and destination content.

Select appropriate error correction. Higher error correction (Level Q or H) allows codes to scan even when partially damaged or obscured, but requires more modules—making the code denser. Use higher levels for codes that will face wear, printing challenges, or partial obstruction. Use lower levels when space is extremely limited and the code will be pristine.

<Callout type="tip" title="Dynamic Code Rule">
When in doubt, create a dynamic code. The flexibility to update destinations and access analytics almost always justifies the choice. The only exception is extremely simple, permanent codes where tracking has no value.

## Design and Visual Quality

How your QR code looks affects both its scannability and its effectiveness at attracting scans in the first place. Aesthetic choices carry functional consequences.

Maintain sufficient contrast between the code and background. The code modules need to be clearly distinguishable from the surrounding area. Black on white provides maximum contrast. Darker colors on lighter backgrounds work well. Avoid similar-value colors (like dark blue on black or light gray on white) that cameras struggle to differentiate.

Preserve the quiet zone—the blank margin around the code. This border needs to measure at least four modules wide, though more provides additional safety. Graphics, text, or other elements that invade the quiet zone can prevent scanning entirely. When placing codes in busy designs, explicitly define the quiet zone and protect it from intrusion.

Size your code appropriately for its scanning distance. The general rule: code width should equal at least 1/10th of the expected scanning distance. A code designed for scanning from one foot away needs to be at least 1.2 inches wide. A code on a poster scanned from ten feet requires at least twelve inches.

Export at high resolution if you're outputting raster formats. For print applications, codes should export at 300 DPI or higher at their final physical size. Low-resolution codes develop fuzzy edges that confuse scanners. Vector formats (SVG) avoid this issue entirely by scaling without quality loss.

Avoid excessive visual complexity if using custom designs. Logos in the center work well because error correction compensates for the obscured area. But heavy stylization, unusual colors, or dramatic module shape changes can push codes past the point where error correction saves them. Test thoroughly whenever departing from standard designs.

## Content and Destination

The page your QR code links to determines whether scans convert to value. A perfect code pointing to a poor destination wastes the opportunity.

Optimize your landing page for mobile viewing. The overwhelming majority of QR scans happen from smartphones. A page that works beautifully on desktop but requires pinching and zooming on mobile frustrates users. Test on actual phones, not just browser emulation modes.

Minimize load time ruthlessly. People scanning QR codes have limited patience. A page that takes more than a few seconds to load loses scanners. Compress images, minimize scripts, and consider accelerated mobile page formats for critical landing pages.

Match the destination to the context and promise. If your code says "Scan for Menu," it should go directly to the menu—not to a homepage where visitors have to hunt for the menu link. If it promises a discount, the discount should be immediately visible after scanning. Bait-and-switch erodes trust.

Ensure the destination remains stable. If the page might move, redirect, or get deleted, use a dynamic code that lets you update the destination. Nothing frustrates users more than scanning a code and landing on a 404 error or a redirect chain that times out.

Consider what happens to first-time versus repeat visitors. Does your landing page assume context that only makes sense for new users? Does it account for people who've already engaged? Thoughtful landing page design recognizes that the same code gets scanned by different people with different needs.

<Callout type="warning" title="The 3-Second Rule">
Users decide within three seconds of a page loading whether to engage or abandon. Your QR code destination must communicate its value and present a clear next action within that window. Slow loads or unclear pages kill conversion.

## Testing Before Deployment

Testing prevents the disasters that become expensive to fix once materials are printed. Every minute spent testing saves potential hours of reprinting, redistributing, and apologizing.

Test the actual code that will be deployed, not a similar one. Export the final production file and test that exact file. Settings, export processes, and final adjustments can introduce issues not present in earlier versions.

Test on multiple devices. iPhone and Android handle QR scanning slightly differently. Older phones have less capable cameras. Test on at least three different devices representing your likely audience—not just your own newest phone.

Test at the actual intended distance. A code that scans easily when held six inches from your face might fail from the three feet that reflects real usage. Simulate real scanning conditions as closely as possible.

Test in representative lighting conditions. Codes that work perfectly indoors might struggle in bright sunlight or dim environments. If your code will appear in variable lighting, test across that range.

Test the destination flow, not just the scan. The scan working is only step one. Click through the entire user journey that follows. Fill out forms. Complete transactions. Verify everything works end-to-end.

Have someone unfamiliar with the code test it. Your own familiarity masks usability issues. Fresh eyes catch problems you've become blind to. Ask a colleague to scan and complete the intended action while you observe.

## Placement and Physical Considerations

Where and how you display your QR code affects whether people notice it, whether they can scan it, and whether the code survives its intended lifespan.

Position codes at comfortable scanning height and angle. Eye level works for most standing applications. Avoid extreme angles that force awkward phone positioning. Consider how people will naturally hold their phones while scanning.

Account for environmental factors. Outdoor codes face sun glare, weather exposure, and temperature extremes. Codes on curved surfaces may distort. Codes in high-traffic areas face wear and damage. Choose materials and placements that suit the environment.

Include a clear call-to-action near the code. People need a reason to scan. "Scan for Menu" or "Scan for 20% Off" outperforms unlabeled codes dramatically. Position the CTA where it's visible from the same distance as the code itself.

Ensure adequate lighting for scanning. Codes in dark corners or shadowed areas challenge phone cameras. Natural light or artificial illumination near codes improves scanning success rates.

Protect codes that will face wear. Lamination, protective overlays, or recessed mounting shield codes from scratches and damage that can prevent scanning. Consider the code's expected lifespan and protect accordingly.

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

Deployment isn't the end—it's the beginning of the code's active life. Ongoing attention ensures codes continue performing.

Monitor scan analytics regularly. Dynamic codes provide data on scan volume, timing, location, and devices. Unexpected patterns—sudden drops, geographic anomalies, unusual device distributions—may indicate problems requiring investigation.

Test periodically after deployment. Physical codes degrade. Destination pages change. What worked at launch might fail months later. Schedule regular scan tests for critical codes.

Update destinations as needed. Dynamic codes let you improve landing pages, redirect expired promotions, and fix issues without reprinting. Use this flexibility proactively, not just in emergencies.

Track conversion metrics beyond just scans. Scans measure awareness; conversions measure value. Connect scan data to downstream actions—signups, purchases, form completions—to understand true code performance.

Plan for code retirement. Every code eventually becomes obsolete. Dynamic codes let you redirect retired codes to appropriate destinations rather than leaving users on outdated pages. Budget for graceful retirement as part of initial planning.
