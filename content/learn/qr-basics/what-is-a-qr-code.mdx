## What is a QR Code?

A **QR code** (Quick Response code) is a two-dimensional barcode that stores information in a pattern of black and white squares. Unlike traditional barcodes that can only be read horizontally, QR codes can be scanned from any direction and store significantly more data.

## How Do QR Codes Work?

When you scan a QR code with your smartphone camera, the device:

1. **Detects the code** using the three distinctive corner squares (finder patterns)
2. **Reads the data** encoded in the grid pattern
3. **Decodes the information** using error correction algorithms
4. **Performs an action** based on the data type (opens a URL, shows text, etc.)

QR codes were invented in 1994 by Masahiro Hara at Denso Wave, a Japanese automotive company. They were originally designed to track vehicles during manufacturing.

## Types of Data QR Codes Can Store

QR codes are incredibly versatile and can encode various types of information:

### URLs and Websites
The most common use - directing users to a webpage when scanned.

### Contact Information (vCard)
Store complete contact details that can be saved directly to a phone's address book.

### WiFi Credentials
Allow instant connection to WiFi networks without typing passwords.

### Plain Text
Display messages, instructions, or any text content.

### Email Addresses
Open the email app with a pre-filled recipient and subject line.

### Phone Numbers
Initiate a phone call with a single scan.

### SMS Messages
Open the messaging app with a pre-filled number and message.

### Geographic Locations
Open maps to show a specific location.

## Why Are QR Codes So Popular?

### Contactless Interaction
The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated QR code adoption as businesses sought contactless ways to share information, from restaurant menus to payment systems.

### Smartphone Integration
Modern smartphones can scan QR codes natively through their camera apps, eliminating the need for separate scanning applications.

### Versatility
QR codes work on virtually any surface - paper, screens, products, billboards, and more.

### Cost-Effective
Creating and printing QR codes is extremely affordable, making them accessible to businesses of all sizes.

## Static vs. Dynamic QR Codes

There are two main types of QR codes:

### Static QR Codes
- Data is encoded directly in the pattern
- Cannot be changed once created
- Free to generate
- Best for permanent information

### Dynamic QR Codes
- Redirect to a URL that can be updated
- Include scan analytics
- Require a service provider
- Best for marketing and business use

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
For business use, always choose dynamic QR codes. The ability to update content and track scans is invaluable for marketing campaigns and operational efficiency.
