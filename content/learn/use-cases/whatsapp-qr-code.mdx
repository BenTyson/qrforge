Asking customers to save your phone number before messaging you on WhatsApp creates friction. Many won't bother. **WhatsApp QR codes** eliminate that barrier—one scan opens a chat with your business, ready to type.

This guide shows you how to create WhatsApp QR codes and use them to connect with customers faster.

## What is a WhatsApp QR Code?

A WhatsApp QR code links directly to a WhatsApp chat with a specific phone number. When someone scans it:

1. WhatsApp opens (or prompts to install)
2. A new chat with your number appears
3. An optional pre-filled message is ready to send
4. They tap send—conversation started

No saving contacts. No typing phone numbers. No searching for your business.

<Callout type="info" title="How It Works">
WhatsApp QR codes use the `wa.me` URL format: `https://wa.me/15551234567?text=Hello`. The QR code simply encodes this link.

## WhatsApp's Built-in QR Code vs Custom

WhatsApp has a built-in QR code feature, but custom QR codes offer more flexibility.

### WhatsApp's Built-in QR Code

**How to find it:**
1. Open WhatsApp
2. Go to Settings
3. Tap your profile or the QR icon
4. Your WhatsApp QR code appears

**Limitations:**
- Basic design (WhatsApp branding)
- No pre-filled message
- No scan tracking
- Can't customize colors

### Custom WhatsApp QR Codes

**Advantages:**
- Match your brand colors
- Add your logo
- Include pre-filled messages
- Track scans (with dynamic codes)
- Professional appearance

## Creating a WhatsApp QR Code

### Step 1: Format Your Phone Number

WhatsApp requires international format without any symbols:

| Your Number | Correct Format |
|-------------|----------------|
| (555) 123-4567 (US) | 15551234567 |
| +44 20 1234 5678 (UK) | 442012345678 |
| +91 98765 43210 (India) | 919876543210 |

**Rules:**
- Include country code (no + sign)
- Remove all spaces, dashes, parentheses
- No leading zeros after country code

### Step 2: Add a Pre-Filled Message (Optional)

Pre-filled messages reduce friction further. The customer just taps send.

**Good pre-filled messages:**
- "Hi! I'd like to learn more about your services."
- "Hello, I scanned your QR code and have a question."
- "I'm interested in [product/service]."

**Keep it short**—they can edit before sending.

### Step 3: Create the QR Code

1. Go to [QRWolf](/create)
2. Select "WhatsApp" as the QR type
3. Enter your phone number (international format)
4. Add optional pre-filled message
5. Customize colors to match your brand
6. Download as PNG or SVG

### Step 4: Test Thoroughly

Before printing or sharing:
- Scan with iPhone
- Scan with Android
- Verify correct phone number opens
- Check pre-filled message appears correctly
- Test on devices without WhatsApp installed

<Callout type="warning" title="Important">
Test from a different phone than the one linked to the WhatsApp number. You can't message yourself on WhatsApp.
</Callout>

## Where to Use WhatsApp QR Codes

### Business Cards

Replace or supplement your phone number with a WhatsApp QR code:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  ACME CONSULTING                │
│  John Smith, Sales              │
│                                 │
│  john@acme.com                  │
│                                 │
│  ┌─────┐                        │
│  │ QR  │  Scan to WhatsApp me   │
│  └─────┘                        │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Retail and Storefronts

Display in your store:
- "Questions? Scan to message us"
- "Scan for today's specials via WhatsApp"
- "Message us for stock inquiries"

### Product Packaging

Include on products:
- "Need help? Scan to chat with support"
- "Scan for recipes and tips"
- "Register your product via WhatsApp"

### Marketing Materials

Add to flyers, brochures, and ads:
- "Get a quote in minutes—scan to chat"
- "Questions? Message us directly"
- "Exclusive offers via WhatsApp"

### Restaurants and Hospitality

- On menus: "Message your server"
- At reception: "Concierge via WhatsApp"
- On tables: "Scan to order"
- On receipts: "Rate your experience"

### Service Businesses

- Appointment booking
- Customer support
- Order status inquiries
- Consultation requests

### Events

- "Questions about the event?"
- "RSVP via WhatsApp"
- "Get updates during the conference"

## WhatsApp QR Code Best Practices

### Use WhatsApp Business

For professional use, set up WhatsApp Business:
- Business profile with hours, address, description
- Automated greeting messages
- Away messages when offline
- Quick replies for common questions
- Labels to organize conversations

### Include Clear CTAs

Never just show a QR code. Tell people what to expect:
- ✅ "Scan to message us on WhatsApp"
- ✅ "WhatsApp us for instant support"
- ❌ "Scan me" (unclear what happens)

### Set Expectations

Let customers know:
- Expected response time
- Business hours
- What they can ask about

### Pre-Filled Message Strategy

Match the context where you display the code:

| Location | Pre-filled Message |
|----------|-------------------|
| Product packaging | "Hi! I just bought [product] and have a question." |
| Business card | "Hi [Name], we met at [event]. Let's connect!" |
| Store display | "Hi! I'm at your [location] store and have a question." |
| Flyer | "I saw your flyer and want to learn more about..." |

### Right Size for Scanning

| Placement | Minimum Size |
|-----------|--------------|
| Business card | 0.75" × 0.75" |
| Flyer | 1" × 1" |
| Poster | 2" × 2" |
| Storefront | 4"+ × 4"+ |

## Dynamic vs Static WhatsApp QR Codes

### Static WhatsApp QR Code
- Encodes the wa.me link directly
- Cannot be changed after creation
- Free
- Works offline

### Dynamic WhatsApp QR Code
- Can update the phone number
- Track scan analytics
- See when and where people scan
- Requires Pro account

<Callout type="tip" title="Recommendation">
Use dynamic codes if you might change phone numbers or want to track engagement. The analytics show which placements drive the most conversations.
</Callout>

## Tracking WhatsApp Conversations

Even without dynamic QR codes, you can track effectiveness:

### Method 1: Unique Pre-filled Messages

Use different messages for different placements:
- Business card: "Scanned from your card"
- Store display: "Scanned at Main Street location"
- Flyer: "Saw your spring flyer"

### Method 2: UTM-Style Tracking

Create separate QR codes for each placement. With dynamic codes, compare scan counts to see what works.

### Method 3: Ask

Simple but effective—ask new contacts where they found you.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Wrong Phone Format

The most common error. WhatsApp links fail if the number format is wrong.

**Wrong:**
- `+1 (555) 123-4567`
- `555-123-4567`
- `1-555-123-4567`

**Correct:**
- `15551234567`

### Mistake 2: No WhatsApp on That Number

Make sure WhatsApp is actually set up on the phone number you're using. Test the link yourself first.

### Mistake 3: Too Long Pre-filled Message

Long messages look spammy and people won't send them. Keep it under 50 characters.

### Mistake 4: Personal Account for Business

Use WhatsApp Business for professional features. Personal accounts lack business profile, automated messages, and organization tools.

### Mistake 5: No Response System

Getting more WhatsApp messages is only useful if you respond promptly. Set up:
- Notification alerts
- Response time expectations
- Team access if needed
- Away messages for off-hours

## WhatsApp Business Features to Know

### Catalog

Create a product catalog within WhatsApp. Share products directly in chat.

### Quick Replies

Save and reuse common messages:
- Pricing information
- Business hours
- Directions
- FAQs

### Labels

Organize conversations:
- New Customer
- Pending Order
- Completed
- VIP

### Broadcast Lists

Send updates to multiple contacts at once (they receive individually, not as a group).

## Privacy and Consent

### Important Considerations

- WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted
- You'll see the customer's phone number
- They'll see your business number
- Save conversations for records if needed

### GDPR/Privacy Compliance

- Only use numbers for stated purposes
- Allow customers to opt out
- Don't share numbers with third parties
- Provide privacy policy access
