The best-designed QR code fails if placed where no one can scan it. Placement determines whether your QR code gets 10 scans or 10,000. This guide covers strategic positioning for maximum engagement across different environments and use cases.

## The Three Pillars of QR Placement

Every placement decision should consider three factors:

### 1. Visibility
Can people see the QR code easily?
- Eye-level positioning
- Adequate size for distance
- Sufficient contrast with surroundings
- Not obscured by other elements

### 2. Accessibility
Can people physically access and scan the code?
- Within comfortable reach
- Stable platform (not moving)
- Good lighting conditions
- Room to position phone

### 3. Context
Does the placement make sense for the action?
- Clear value proposition
- Relevant to user's current activity
- Timely (user has time to scan)
- Logical flow from scan to action

## Height and Position Guidelines

### Eye-Level Placement

The optimal height range for most standing adults:

| Position | Height Range | Best For |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| Upper optimal | 5'6" - 6'0" (168-183cm) | Quick glance situations |
| Center optimal | 4'6" - 5'6" (137-168cm) | Most contexts |
| Lower accessible | 3'6" - 4'6" (107-137cm) | Children, wheelchair users |

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
For maximum accessibility, place QR codes at 4'6" (137cm) from the floor—comfortable for most adults and accessible for wheelchair users.
</Callout>

### Seated Contexts

When users are seated (restaurants, waiting rooms, transportation):

| Context | Recommended Position |
|---------|---------------------|
| Table tent | Center of table, facing user |
| Menu | Top quarter of first page |
| Seat back | Eye level when seated (3'0"-3'6") |
| Armrest/tray | Directly visible without leaning |

## Environment-Specific Placement

### Retail Environments

**Shelf-Level Placement:**
- Shelf edge labels: align with product
- End caps: upper third of display
- Checkout: eye level when standing in line
- Fitting rooms: next to mirror, eye level

**Window Displays:**
- Inside, facing out (avoid glass reflection)
- Lower third of window (easier angle)
- Dark background behind code

**Product Packaging:**
- Flat surfaces preferred
- Avoid curves and creases
- Size proportional to package

### Restaurant and Hospitality

**Table Placement:**
- Table tents: 4-5 inch codes, center of table
- Menu corners: top-right of first page
- Placemats: center or top edge
- Table stickers: away from wet areas

**High-Traffic Areas:**
- Host stand: eye level, visible to waiting guests
- Restrooms: eye level near sink
- Exit areas: for feedback collection

<Callout type="warning" title="Important">
In food service environments, QR codes must be on wipeable surfaces or under lamination. Replace frequently if using paper materials.
</Callout>

### Office and Corporate

**Meeting Rooms:**
- Near displays/screens: for presentation materials
- Table centers: for meeting agendas
- Door frames: for room booking/schedules

**Reception Areas:**
- Check-in kiosk: eye level
- Visitor information: on desk, facing visitor
- Company information: near seating

**Workspaces:**
- Equipment: on device, not covering controls
- Supply rooms: at eye level on shelving
- Common areas: bulletin boards, break rooms

### Healthcare Facilities

**Patient Areas:**
- Waiting rooms: on walls at seated eye level
- Exam rooms: visible from patient position
- Discharge: on paperwork, large and clear

**Wayfinding:**
- Hallway junctions: consistent height throughout
- Elevator lobbies: visible while waiting
- Department entrances: before entry point

### Outdoor and Public Spaces

**Signage:**
- Posters: lower third (3-4 feet from ground)
- Billboards: size must match viewing distance
- Bus shelters: eye level when seated/standing

**Events:**
- Entry points: before ticket scanning
- Vendor booths: table-top or eye level
- Stage/screen adjacency: near relevant content

## Material-Specific Considerations

### Paper and Print

| Material | Placement Tip |
|----------|---------------|
| Brochures | Front cover or inside first page |
| Flyers | Upper half, adequate quiet zone |
| Posters | Lower third for accessibility |
| Business cards | Back, centered |
| Books/magazines | Margin-safe placement |

### Digital Screens

- **TV/monitor**: Corner placement, persistent display
- **Presentations**: End slides or sidebar
- **Kiosks**: Touch-adjacent but scan-friendly
- **Mobile**: Avoid (can't scan own screen)

### Product Packaging

- **Boxes**: Largest flat surface
- **Bottles**: Label area, avoid curve
- **Bags**: Upper front surface
- **Tags**: One side only, flat

### Textiles and Apparel

- **T-shirts**: Back, upper area (6-8" code)
- **Banners**: Lower section, larger codes
- **Tablecloths**: Edge placement
- **Flags**: Avoid (movement prevents scanning)

## Lighting Considerations

### Natural Lighting

| Condition | Impact | Solution |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Bright sun | Glare, washout | Matte materials, shaded placement |
| Overcast | Good | Standard placement |
| Shade | Good | Ensure adequate contrast |
| Night | Requires illumination | Backlit or spot-lit placement |

### Artificial Lighting

**Best practices:**
- Even, diffuse lighting
- Avoid spotlights directly on code (glare)
- Ensure minimum 50 lux at code surface
- Consider lighting changes throughout day

<Callout type="info" title="Did You Know?">
Backlit signs with QR codes scan exceptionally well because the light shines through the white areas, creating perfect contrast. Consider backlit placement for 24/7 scanning availability.

## Avoiding Common Placement Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Behind Glass

Glass creates problems:
- Reflections interfere with scanning
- Smudges and dirt accumulate
- Angle of glass affects readability

**If glass is unavoidable:**
- Use anti-glare glass
- Angle away from direct light
- Keep glass immaculately clean
- Test extensively before deployment

### Mistake 2: Moving Surfaces

Codes on moving objects fail:
- Rotating displays
- Scrolling screens
- Vehicle exteriors (while moving)
- Escalator risers

**Exception:** Slow-moving surfaces (very slow conveyor, parked vehicles) can work if users have time to scan.

### Mistake 3: Too High or Too Low

Problems with extreme placement:
- Above 7 feet: Most people can't reach to scan
- Below 2 feet: Uncomfortable and awkward
- At floor level: Dirty, hard to see, impossible to scan

### Mistake 4: Crowded Visual Space

QR codes lost in busy environments:
- Among many other codes
- Surrounded by text and images
- On pattern backgrounds
- Competing for attention

**Solution:** Isolate QR codes with white space and clear calls-to-action.

### Mistake 5: No Context or CTA

Codes without explanation get ignored:
- "Scan me" is not enough
- Users need to know the benefit
- Include clear call-to-action

**Good example:** "Scan for exclusive 20% discount"
**Poor example:** [QR code with no text]

## Maximizing Scan Rates

### Create Scanning Motivation

| Motivation Type | Example CTA |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Information | "Scan for full menu" |
| Discount | "Scan for 15% off" |
| Convenience | "Scan to skip the line" |
| Exclusive content | "Scan for behind-the-scenes video" |
| Utility | "Scan to connect to WiFi" |

### Remove Friction

Make scanning as easy as possible:
- Direct line of sight
- No obstacles between user and code
- Adequate space to position phone
- Good lighting
- Clean, well-maintained code

### Create Scanning Moments

Place codes where users have:
- **Time** - Waiting situations (lines, lobbies)
- **Interest** - Next to engaging content
- **Need** - Where information would help
- **Habit** - Consistent locations users learn

## Testing Your Placements

### Pre-Launch Testing

Before finalizing placement:

1. **Device testing** - Multiple phones, different cameras
2. **Distance testing** - Various scanning distances
3. **Angle testing** - Straight-on and oblique angles
4. **Lighting testing** - Different times of day
5. **User testing** - Watch real people attempt scans

### Post-Launch Analytics

Track these metrics with dynamic QR codes:

- **Scan rate by location** - Which placements perform best
- **Time-of-day patterns** - When do scans happen
- **Device types** - Are certain users having trouble
- **Completion rate** - Do users finish the intended action
