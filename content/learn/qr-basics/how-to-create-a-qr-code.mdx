Creating a QR code takes less than a minute when you know what you're doing. Whether you need a QR code for your website, WiFi network, business card, or restaurant menu, the process is straightforward.

This guide walks you through **how to create a QR code** step by step, covering all the different types and customization options available.

## What You'll Need

Before creating your QR code, decide:

1. **What type of QR code** - URL, WiFi, contact card, etc.
2. **The content** - The actual data (website address, WiFi password, etc.)
3. **Static or dynamic** - Can you change it later? ([Learn the difference](/learn/static-vs-dynamic-qr-codes))

That's it. No special software, no technical skills required.

## Step 1: Choose Your QR Code Type

QR codes can encode different types of information. The most common types are:

| Type | What It Does | Example Use |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **URL** | Opens a website | Marketing materials, product pages |
| **WiFi** | Connects to network | Home, office, restaurants |
| **vCard** | Saves contact info | Business cards, email signatures |
| **Text** | Displays plain text | Instructions, messages |
| **Email** | Opens email composer | Contact forms, support |
| **Phone** | Initiates phone call | Business cards, ads |
| **SMS** | Opens text message | Opt-in campaigns |

<Callout type="tip" title="Most Popular Choice">
URL QR codes account for over 50% of all QR codes created. If you're unsure, start with a URL that links to a webpage with all your information.

## Step 2: Enter Your Content

Once you've chosen your type, enter the specific content:

### For URL QR Codes
Enter the full website address:
```
https://yourwebsite.com/landing-page
```

**Tips:**
- Include `https://` for security
- Use a short, memorable URL
- Consider using UTM parameters for tracking

### For WiFi QR Codes
You'll need:
- **Network name (SSID)**: Exactly as it appears
- **Password**: Case-sensitive
- **Security type**: Usually WPA/WPA2

### For vCard QR Codes
Enter your contact details:
- Name
- Phone number
- Email address
- Company (optional)
- Job title (optional)
- Website (optional)

### For Other Types
Each type has specific fields. The QR generator will guide you through what's needed.

## Step 3: Customize the Design (Optional)

Plain black-and-white QR codes work fine, but customization helps with:
- **Brand recognition** - Match your company colors
- **Visual appeal** - Stand out on marketing materials
- **Scannability** - When done correctly

### Color Customization

**Do:**
- Use dark colors for the pattern (foreground)
- Use light colors for the background
- Maintain high contrast (at least 3:1 ratio)

**Don't:**
- Invert colors (light pattern on dark background)
- Use similar colors for foreground and background
- Use gradients in the pattern itself

### Adding a Logo

Many QR generators let you add a logo in the center. This works because of QR code error correction—the code can lose up to 30% of its data and still scan.

**Logo best practices:**
- Keep it small (15-25% of QR code size)
- Use simple, high-contrast logos
- Square or circular shapes work best
- Test thoroughly after adding

<Callout type="warning" title="Important">
Always test your customized QR code on multiple devices before printing. Heavy customization can affect scannability.

## Step 4: Download Your QR Code

QR codes come in different file formats:

| Format | Best For | File Size |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **PNG** | Digital use, printing | Medium |
| **SVG** | Scalable printing, large formats | Small |
| **PDF** | Print-ready documents | Medium |

**Resolution guidelines:**
- Web/digital: 200×200 pixels minimum
- Print: 300 DPI or higher
- Large format: Use SVG for infinite scaling

## Step 5: Test Before Using

Never skip testing. A QR code that doesn't scan is worse than no QR code.

**Testing checklist:**
- [ ] Scan with iPhone camera
- [ ] Scan with Android camera
- [ ] Test in different lighting conditions
- [ ] Verify the destination is correct
- [ ] Check that the page loads properly on mobile

## Creating Different QR Code Types

### How to Create a URL QR Code

1. Go to [QRWolf](/create)
2. Select "URL" as the type
3. Enter your website address
4. Customize colors if desired
5. Download as PNG or SVG

**Pro tip:** Use a URL shortener or [dynamic QR code](/learn/static-vs-dynamic-qr-codes) if you might need to change the destination later.

### How to Create a WiFi QR Code

2. Select "WiFi" as the type
3. Enter your network name exactly as shown on your device
4. Enter the password (case-sensitive)
5. Select security type (usually WPA2)
6. Download and display near your router

**Pro tip:** Create a separate guest network for public WiFi QR codes.

### How to Create a vCard QR Code

1. Go to [QRWolf](/create)
2. Select "vCard" as the type
3. Fill in your contact information
4. Add optional fields (company, title, website)
5. Download and add to business cards

**Pro tip:** Dynamic vCards let you update your contact info without reprinting cards.

### How to Create a Menu QR Code

## Static vs Dynamic: Which Should You Create?

**Static QR codes:**
- Data encoded directly in the code
- Cannot be changed after creation
- Free, no account needed
- Best for: Permanent information

**Dynamic QR codes:**
- Link through a redirect URL
- Can be updated anytime
- Require an account
- Include scan analytics
- Best for: Marketing, menus, anything that changes

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Making It Too Small
QR codes need to be large enough to scan. Minimum sizes:
- Business cards: 0.8" × 0.8"
- Flyers: 1" × 1"
- Posters: 2"+ × 2"+

### Mistake 2: Low Contrast Colors
Light gray on white won't scan. Always maintain high contrast between the pattern and background.

### Mistake 3: Not Testing
Print one test copy before ordering 1,000. Test on multiple devices in real conditions.

### Mistake 4: Broken Links
If your URL changes and you used a static QR code, every printed code is now useless. Use dynamic codes for anything that might change.

### Mistake 5: No Call to Action
A QR code alone doesn't tell people what to do. Always include text like "Scan for menu" or "Scan to connect."

## Advanced Tips

### Adding UTM Parameters for Tracking

If you use Google Analytics, add UTM parameters to track QR code performance:

```
https://yoursite.com/page?utm_source=qr&utm_medium=print&utm_campaign=flyer
```

### Creating Multiple QR Codes for A/B Testing

Create different QR codes for different placements to see which performs better:
- One for window display
- One for flyers
- One for business cards

Track scans for each to optimize your strategy.

### Batch Creating QR Codes

Need many QR codes at once? [Business tier](/plans) includes bulk generation via CSV upload—perfect for inventory, products, or events.
