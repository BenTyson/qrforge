Getting QR code size wrong means either wasting space with unnecessarily large codes or frustrating users with codes too small to scan reliably. The relationship between code size and scanning distance follows predictable rules, and understanding these rules helps you calculate the right dimensions for any application without guesswork.

The underlying principle is straightforward: cameras need to resolve individual modules (the black and white squares) within the QR code. Smaller codes at greater distances fall below this resolution threshold. The calculation involves your intended scanning distance, the code's module count, and the camera capabilities of typical smartphones.

## The 10:1 Distance-to-Size Rule

A practical guideline that works for most situations: the scanning distance should be no more than 10 times the QR code's smallest dimension. A 2-inch QR code reliably scans from 20 inches away. A 1-foot code scans from 10 feet. This ratio accounts for typical smartphone cameras and average scanning conditions.

The rule builds in safety margin for real-world variability. Camera quality differs between devices. Lighting conditions affect contrast detection. Users don't always hold their phones perfectly steady or perfectly perpendicular to the code. The 10:1 ratio ensures reliable scanning across this variability rather than optimizing for ideal conditions that rarely exist.

For critical applications where scanning must work every time, use a more conservative 7:1 or 8:1 ratio. For controlled environments with good lighting and motivated users, you might push to 12:1. But 10:1 provides a reliable default that works across most situations without excessive caution or unnecessary risk.

Applying this rule in reverse helps when space is constrained. If your code must fit in a 1-inch square, expect reliable scanning from no more than 10 inches—essentially arm's length. This limitation might be acceptable for business cards held in hand but problematic for posters viewed from across a room.

## Calculating Minimum Size for Distance

When you know the scanning distance you need to support, calculate the minimum code size by dividing distance by 10. A code on a trade show banner viewed from 15 feet needs to be at least 1.5 feet (18 inches) on each side. A code on a restaurant table tent scanned from 18 inches needs to be at least 1.8 inches.

These calculations assume the code will be the constraining factor. In practice, you'll often size codes based on available space rather than minimum requirements, resulting in codes that exceed the minimum. This is fine—larger codes scan more easily, not less easily. The calculation tells you the floor, not the ceiling.

Consider the expected distance range, not just the average. A poster might be viewed from 3 feet by someone walking past or 8 feet by someone across the room. Size for the maximum expected distance to ensure the code works for everyone, even if closer viewers could have scanned a smaller code.

<Callout type="tip" title="Quick Reference">
For a code that will be scanned from 3 feet (typical for retail displays), you need at least a 3.6-inch code. For 6 feet (indoor signage), at least 7.2 inches. For 10 feet (large banners), at least 12 inches.

## Module Size and Code Complexity

The 10:1 rule addresses overall code size, but the underlying physics involve individual module resolution. A QR code consists of a grid of modules—Version 1 has 21×21 modules, Version 40 has 177×177. Each module must be large enough for the camera to distinguish it from its neighbors.

Minimum module size depends on scanning conditions, but 0.02 inches (about 0.5mm) represents a practical floor for typical smartphone cameras. Below this size, even close-range scanning becomes unreliable. This constraint matters when encoding long URLs or large amounts of data, which require higher-version codes with more modules.

A Version 1 code at 0.5-inch total size has modules of roughly 0.024 inches (0.5 ÷ 21)—scannable but near the limit. The same 0.5-inch size for a Version 10 code (57×57 modules) yields modules of only 0.009 inches—far too small to scan reliably. Complex data requires larger codes not because of some abstract rule but because the physics of camera resolution demands it.

This explains why URL shorteners matter for QR codes. A shorter URL means a lower-version code, which means fewer modules, which means each module can be larger at any given total code size. Converting a 100-character URL to a 20-character shortened URL can dramatically reduce minimum viable size.

## Print Resolution Considerations

Digital display and print introduce different considerations. Screens have fixed pixel densities, while print can vary widely in resolution. Understanding these differences ensures your code renders with sufficient precision.

Print resolution, measured in DPI (dots per inch), determines how finely details can be reproduced. Commercial printing typically achieves 300 DPI or higher, easily handling QR codes of any reasonable size. Home and office printers vary widely—some achieve 1200 DPI, others struggle to clearly render small modules.

A module that measures 0.02 inches requires 6 printer dots at 300 DPI to render its width. This allows adequate definition of the module boundaries. At 150 DPI, the same module gets only 3 dots—barely sufficient and vulnerable to slight printing variations. Higher print resolution enables smaller modules and therefore smaller codes.

For digital displays, pixel density varies by device. A code displayed on a 4K monitor has more pixels per inch than one on a 1080p screen of the same physical size. When codes will be scanned from screens, ensure adequate pixel density or size the code larger to compensate.

Export your QR codes at higher resolution than you think you need. A code generated at 500×500 pixels might look fine on screen but appear fuzzy when scaled up for print. Generate at 2000×2000 or higher—or use SVG format for infinite scalability—to ensure sharp output at any final size.

## Environmental Factors

The 10:1 rule assumes reasonable conditions, but real environments often diverge from reasonable. Adjusting for environmental factors prevents failed scans that pure calculations wouldn't predict.

Lighting affects contrast detection. QR codes work by distinguishing dark from light, and low-light conditions reduce this distinction. Outdoor codes in shadow, indoor codes in dim restaurants, or codes illuminated by colored lights all reduce effective contrast. Size codes larger in challenging lighting conditions to compensate—the camera needs more signal to work with.

Glare and reflection can completely obscure portions of a code. Laminated surfaces, glossy paper, and backlit displays all risk reflection problems. Consider matte finishes for printed codes, and test under the actual lighting conditions where codes will be scanned.

Motion affects scanning success. A code on a moving conveyor, a rotating display, or even a poster that sways in wind creates challenges beyond what static calculations address. Faster motion requires larger codes or smarter placement that minimizes relative movement during the scan attempt.

Viewing angle matters because QR codes appear smaller when viewed at an angle. A code scanned perpendicular to the camera face presents its full dimensions; the same code scanned at 45 degrees appears compressed. Placement that encourages perpendicular scanning—or sizing that tolerates angular compression—improves reliability.

## Size Recommendations by Application

Common applications have typical viewing distances that suggest standard sizing. These recommendations apply the 10:1 rule to typical scenarios, providing starting points for your own calculations.

Business cards, held at arm's length during exchange, support codes as small as 0.75 inches. The more common 1-inch sizing provides comfortable margin for various lighting conditions and quick scanning.

Product packaging varies enormously, but codes intended for scanning during shelf consideration (roughly 12-18 inches) need to be at least 1.5 inches. Codes meant for post-purchase scanning at closer range can be smaller.

Table tents and restaurant materials typically see 18-24 inch scanning distance, requiring codes of at least 2 inches. Common sizing runs 2.5-3 inches for comfortable scanning.

Retail signage at 3-6 foot viewing distance requires 4-8 inch codes. Window displays, endcap signs, and similar materials fall in this range.

Trade show banners and large-format displays intended for 10+ foot scanning need codes of 12 inches or larger. These codes look small relative to the overall banner but large in absolute terms.

## Using the Calculator Tool

For those who prefer automation over arithmetic, [QRWolf's size calculator tool](/tools/size-calculator) does the math for you. Enter your expected scanning distance, and it recommends minimum code size. Enter your available space, and it confirms whether that size will work for your distance requirements.

The tool also accounts for code complexity. After you've created your QR code, you can check whether your planned size accommodates the actual module count. A URL-only code has different size requirements than a vCard with complete contact information.

Use the calculator during planning before you commit to print specifications. Discovering that your code needs to be larger than the space allows is much better encountered during design than after printing.
