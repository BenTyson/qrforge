Creating a QR code for a link is one of the most common QR code uses—and fortunately, one of the simplest. Whether you want to share your website, a specific landing page, a signup form, or any other URL, you can have a working QR code in under two minutes.

This guide walks through the complete process, from choosing the right type of QR code to downloading a print-ready file, with practical advice on avoiding common mistakes that lead to codes that don't scan or destinations that disappoint.

## Before You Start: Static vs Dynamic

The first decision you'll make affects everything that follows, so it's worth understanding clearly.

A **static QR code** encodes your URL directly into the code's pattern. The destination is permanent—once created, it cannot be changed. This works fine for personal use or situations where you're absolutely certain the URL will never change. Static codes are free to create and work forever without any ongoing service.

A **dynamic QR code** encodes a short redirect URL that you control. The QR code itself never changes, but you can update where it redirects at any time. This matters enormously for business use because URLs change. Websites get redesigned, campaigns end, pages move—and with a static code on printed materials, you're stuck with whatever you originally encoded.

For any URL QR code you plan to print on materials that cost money to reproduce, dynamic codes are worth the small subscription cost. The first time you need to change a destination without reprinting, the investment pays for itself.

## Step 1: Prepare Your URL

Before creating your QR code, make sure your destination URL is ready.

**Use the final URL**, not a shortened version that might break. If you're linking to a Google Doc, make sure sharing permissions allow access. If you're linking to a form, confirm it's published. If you're linking to a page behind a login, consider whether scanners will have credentials.

**Test the URL on mobile** since that's where virtually all scans happen. Load it on your phone and check that the page displays correctly, loads quickly, and achieves whatever goal you have for visitors. A QR code that works perfectly but leads to a broken mobile experience wastes the effort.

**Consider adding UTM parameters** if you want to track QR code traffic separately in your analytics. A URL like `example.com/landing?utm_source=qr&utm_medium=print&utm_campaign=spring2026` lets you identify exactly how much traffic comes from your QR code versus other channels.

## Step 2: Choose a QR Code Generator

Dozens of QR code generators exist online. The important distinctions are whether they offer dynamic codes, what customization options they provide, and whether they include analytics.

For a simple static code with basic customization, many free tools work fine. For dynamic codes with tracking, logo support, and the ability to update destinations, you'll want a service like QRWolf that specializes in these features.

Navigate to [QRWolf.com](/) and click "Create QR Code" to begin. You can create your first code without signing up, though you'll need an account to save dynamic codes.

## Step 3: Select URL as Your Content Type

QR code generators offer various content types—URL, text, WiFi, vCard, and others. For linking to a website or web page, select **URL** (sometimes labeled "Website" or "Link").

The URL type is optimized for web addresses. It ensures proper formatting and typically produces the most efficient QR code pattern for link destinations.

## Step 4: Enter Your Link

Paste or type your complete URL into the destination field. Include the full address with `https://` at the beginning. Most generators will add this automatically if you forget, but being explicit avoids potential issues.

Double-check for typos. A single wrong character creates a completely different destination—or an error page. Copy-paste from your browser's address bar when possible rather than typing manually.

If you're creating a dynamic QR code, this is also where you'll name your code for easy identification in your dashboard later. Use descriptive names like "Spring Catalog Back Cover" rather than generic ones like "QR Code 1."

## Step 5: Customize the Appearance

Default QR codes work fine functionally, but customization makes them more effective and on-brand.

**Colors**: Change the code color (the dark squares) and background color (the light squares) to match your brand. Maintain high contrast—dark colors on light backgrounds scan most reliably. Avoid low-contrast combinations like yellow on white or light gray on white.

**Logo**: Adding your logo to the center of the QR code reinforces brand recognition. Keep logos simple and relatively small—they shouldn't obscure too much of the code. QR codes have error correction that allows them to scan even with a center logo, but don't push it too far.

**Patterns and shapes**: Some generators offer different module shapes (rounded corners, dots, etc.) and eye styles. These can make codes more visually distinctive while remaining fully functional.

**Frame and call-to-action**: Adding text like "Scan Me" or "Visit Our Site" around the code increases scan rates by telling people what to do and what they'll get.

## Step 6: Test Before Downloading

This step is critical and frequently skipped, leading to printed materials with non-functional codes.

Open your phone's camera app and scan the QR code preview. Verify that it scans quickly and easily. Check that it leads to the correct destination. Load the page and confirm it displays properly on mobile.

Test on multiple devices if possible. What scans fine on the latest iPhone might struggle on an older Android phone. Testing catches problems before they're printed on thousands of materials.

If the code doesn't scan reliably, try increasing contrast, removing or shrinking the logo, or simplifying the design. Function always trumps aesthetics for QR codes.

## Step 7: Download in the Right Format

QR code generators typically offer PNG, SVG, and sometimes PDF downloads. Choose based on your use case.

**PNG** works for most digital uses and basic print applications. Download at the highest resolution available—you can always scale down, but you can't add quality to a low-resolution file.

**SVG** (vector format) is ideal for print, especially large-format printing. Vector files scale to any size without losing quality. If your printer or designer requests vector files, SVG is what they need.

**PDF** serves similar purposes to SVG for print workflows and works well when sharing with designers or print shops.

Download your file and save it somewhere organized. If you're creating multiple QR codes, establish a naming convention that helps you identify each code's purpose later.

## Step 8: Print at the Right Size

QR codes need adequate size to scan reliably. The minimum depends on scanning distance.

For materials people hold in their hands—business cards, flyers, product tags—2-2.5 centimeters (about 1 inch) is the minimum. Larger is better when space allows.

For materials viewed from farther away—posters, banners, signage—increase size proportionally. A general rule: the QR code should be at least 1/10th the expected scanning distance. Two meters away means at least 20 centimeters.

Maintain clear space around the code (the "quiet zone") of at least 4 modules wide. This border helps scanners identify where the code begins and ends.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Linking to URLs that require login**: Unless you're certain every scanner will be authenticated, they'll hit a login wall and give up.

**Using URL shorteners unnecessarily**: Shorteners like bit.ly add a redirect and a potential point of failure. For dynamic QR codes, the redirect is already built in. For static codes, the full URL is more reliable.

**Forgetting mobile optimization**: Your landing page must work on phones. Test it yourself before promoting it via QR code.

**Printing too small**: When in doubt, make the code bigger. A code that's too large still works; a code that's too small doesn't scan.

**Skipping the test scan**: Every QR code you create should be tested before use. Every single one.

**Using static codes for content that might change**: If there's any chance you'll need to update the destination, use a dynamic code.

## After You Print: Tracking Performance

If you've created a dynamic QR code, your dashboard shows scan analytics: how many people scanned, when, from where, and on what devices. This data informs decisions about placement, timing, and future QR code use.

For static codes, you won't have built-in analytics, but UTM parameters let you track QR code traffic in Google Analytics or similar tools.

Review your analytics periodically. High-traffic codes might warrant A/B testing with different destinations. Low-traffic codes might need better placement or more compelling calls-to-action on the printed material.
