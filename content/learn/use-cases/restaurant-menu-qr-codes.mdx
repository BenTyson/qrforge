## Why Restaurants Love QR Code Menus

QR code menus have transformed the restaurant industry. What started as a contactless solution during the pandemic has become a permanent fixture in restaurants worldwide, offering benefits that go far beyond safety.

## Benefits of QR Code Menus

### For Restaurants

- **Instant updates** - Change prices or items without reprinting
- **Cost savings** - Eliminate printing costs
- **Analytics** - See which items get viewed most
- **Upselling** - Add photos and descriptions easily
- **Multiple languages** - Serve international guests

### For Customers

- **Always current** - No more "sorry, we're out of that"
- **Visual menus** - See photos of every dish
- **Allergy info** - Filter by dietary restrictions
- **Easy sharing** - Send menu to friends before they arrive

## Setting Up Your QR Code Menu

### Step 1: Create Your Digital Menu

You have several options:

1. **PDF menu** - Upload your existing menu as a PDF
2. **Website page** - Link to a menu page on your site
3. **Menu builder** - Use QRWolf's built-in menu builder

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
Use a dedicated menu builder rather than a PDF. Digital menus with photos, categories, and descriptions significantly outperform static PDFs in customer engagement.

### Step 2: Generate Your QR Code

1. Log into QRWolf
2. Select "Menu" as your QR type
3. Build or link your menu
4. Customize the QR code design
5. Download in PNG or SVG format

### Step 3: Design Table Materials

Consider these placement options:

| Placement | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|------|------|
| Table tent | Highly visible | Takes up table space |
| Table sticker | Permanent, clean | Hard to remove |
| Menu holder | Professional | Extra cost |
| Coaster | Subtle | May be moved/lost |

### Step 4: Test Thoroughly

Before rolling out:

- Test with multiple phone types
- Check in different lighting conditions
- Verify menu loads quickly
- Test your WiFi capacity

## Best Practices for Restaurant QR Codes

### Size and Placement

- **Minimum size**: 3cm x 3cm (larger is better)
- **Height**: Eye-level when seated
- **Lighting**: Ensure adequate light for scanning
- **Angle**: Flat or slightly angled toward guest

### Design Tips

- Use your brand colors
- Add your logo to the QR code
- Include "Scan for Menu" text
- Keep background contrasting

### Menu Content

- High-quality food photos
- Clear pricing
- Ingredient lists for allergies
- Category organization
- Daily specials section

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Poor WiFi
Customers can't load your menu if your WiFi is slow. Ensure adequate bandwidth.

### 2. No Fallback
Always have physical menus available for customers who prefer them or have scanning issues.

### 3. Dead Links
Using static QR codes means you can't fix broken links. Always use dynamic codes.

### 4. Tiny Codes
Codes that are too small are frustrating to scan. Bigger is always better.

### 5. Low Contrast
Light gray on white doesn't scan well. Maintain high contrast.

## Advanced Strategies

### Multiple Menus

Create separate QR codes for:
- Lunch menu
- Dinner menu
- Drinks menu
- Dessert menu
- Kids menu

### Time-Based Switching

With dynamic QR codes, automatically switch between menus based on time of day.

### Analytics-Driven Optimization

Track which menu items get the most views and adjust placement for underperforming items.

### Integration with Ordering

Link your QR menu directly to your ordering system for seamless table-to-kitchen workflow.

## Customer Experience Tips

### Add Clear Instructions

Not everyone knows how to scan a QR code. Include simple text:

> "Open your phone camera and point it at the code"

### Offer Alternatives

Some customers prefer physical menus. That's okay! Have a few on hand.

### Train Your Staff

Ensure all staff can help customers who struggle with scanning.

## Measuring Success

- **Total scans** - Overall engagement
- **Peak scan times** - Busiest menu viewing periods
- **Return visitors** - Customer loyalty indicator
