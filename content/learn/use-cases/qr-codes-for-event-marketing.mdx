Events live and die by engagement. Whether you're organizing a conference, concert, trade show, or community gathering, getting people to show up and participate is half the battle. **QR codes** have become essential tools for event marketers—bridging the gap between physical promotional materials and digital experiences.

From pre-event promotion to post-event surveys, QR codes create touchpoints that are easy to execute and easy to measure.

## Pre-Event: Driving Registrations

### Promotional Materials

Every piece of event collateral should include a QR code linking to registration:

| Material | QR Code Placement | Best Practice |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Posters | Bottom right corner | Large size, high contrast |
| Flyers | Near the headline | Include "Scan to Register" CTA |
| Direct mail | Back or bottom | Test scan before mailing |
| Business cards | Full back | Personal invite feel |
| Banners | Eye level | Minimum 4" × 4" size |

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
Use dynamic QR codes for promotional materials. If your registration URL changes or you need to redirect to an "event full" page, you can update instantly without reprinting.

### Social Media Integration

QR codes bridge offline and online promotion:

- **Print ads with social handles**: QR code links to your event's Instagram or LinkedIn
- **Early bird specials**: Exclusive QR codes in partner newsletters
- **Influencer collaborations**: Trackable QR codes for each promoter to measure referrals

### Location-Based Promotion

Geo-target your promotion with QR codes in strategic locations:

- Coffee shops near your venue
- Public transit stations
- Partner business locations
- Local community boards

Track which locations drive the most registrations using unique QR codes per placement.

## During the Event: Enhancing Experience

### Check-In and Access

QR code tickets have become standard for modern events:

**Benefits:**
- Faster check-in (scan vs manual lookup)
- Reduced fraud (unique codes per ticket)
- Contactless entry (important for health considerations)
- Easy upgrades (scan badge for VIP access areas)

**Implementation:**
1. Generate unique QR code per registration
2. Email ticket with QR code attached
3. Scan at entry with smartphone or dedicated scanner
4. System validates and marks ticket as used

### Session and Workshop Sign-ups

For multi-track events, QR codes streamline session management:

- Display QR code outside each room
- Attendees scan to confirm attendance
- Real-time capacity tracking
- Automatic waitlist management

### Networking and Contact Exchange

Replace paper business cards with digital exchanges:

- **Badge QR codes**: Each attendee gets a QR code linking to their LinkedIn or contact info
- **Exhibitor booth codes**: Scan to download exhibitor info and enter drawings
- **Speaker codes**: Links to slide decks, contact info, or scheduling a follow-up call

### Interactive Engagement

Boost engagement with QR-powered activities:

| Activity | How It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| Live polling | Scan to access poll, see results on screen |
| Q&A submission | Scan to submit questions anonymously |
| Scavenger hunts | Scan codes at different booths to win prizes |
| Photo sharing | Scan to upload photos to event gallery |
| Feedback collection | Scan to rate sessions immediately after |

### Sponsor and Exhibitor Value

QR codes provide measurable value for sponsors:

- Track scans per sponsor booth
- Lead capture via QR code forms
- Digital brochures instead of printed materials
- Exclusive content unlocks for booth visitors

Sponsors love data—give them scan counts, geographic breakdown, and engagement metrics to justify their investment.

## Post-Event: Follow-Up and Measurement

### Survey Distribution

Strike while the iron is hot:

- Display survey QR codes at exits
- Include in "thank you for attending" slides
- Print on event bags or swag
- Send email with QR code for mobile-easy access

### Content Access

Extend event value with QR-gated content:

- Presentation slides and recordings
- Speaker contact information
- Exclusive post-event resources
- Early access to next year's tickets

### Measuring Success

Dynamic QR codes provide clear metrics:

**Track:**
- Total scans per placement
- Conversion rate (scans → registrations)
- Geographic distribution
- Time patterns (when do people engage?)
- Device breakdown (mobile vs desktop)

**Calculate:**
- Cost per registration by channel
- ROI per promotional placement
- Sponsor value delivered

## Event QR Code Best Practices

### Design for Scannability

Event environments are challenging—crowds, movement, varied lighting:

- **Size**: Minimum 1.5" for handheld materials, 3"+ for posters
- **Contrast**: Black on white works in all lighting
- **Error correction**: Use high error correction (QRWolf handles this automatically)
- **Testing**: Scan test in similar lighting conditions

### Clear Call-to-Action

Never display a QR code without context:

- ✅ "Scan to Register"
- ✅ "Scan for Schedule"
- ✅ "Connect with [Speaker Name]"
- ❌ Just a QR code with no text

### Mobile-Optimized Destinations

90%+ of event QR scans happen on mobile:

- Fast loading pages (under 3 seconds)
- Large tap targets for buttons
- Simple forms (minimize typing)
- Auto-fill enabled where possible

### Backup Options

Technology fails. Always have alternatives:

- Print shortened URLs alongside QR codes
- Staff with manual check-in capabilities
- Paper backup for critical functions

<Callout type="warning" title="Important">
Test all QR codes on multiple devices the day of the event. WiFi availability, cellular signal, and URL validity can all cause issues.
