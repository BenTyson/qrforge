A plain black-and-white QR code gets the job done, but it doesn't say anything about who you are. Adding your logo transforms a generic square into a branded touchpoint—one that reinforces your identity every time someone scans it.

The good news is that QR codes are remarkably resilient. Thanks to built-in error correction, you can place a logo directly in the center of a code and it will still scan perfectly. The key is understanding how much real estate you can claim without crossing the line into unreadable territory.

## Why Logos Work Inside QR Codes

When Denso Wave invented QR codes in 1994, they built in a feature called **error correction**. The original purpose was practical: factory floors are harsh environments, and labels get scratched, smudged, or partially obscured. Error correction ensures that even a damaged code remains scannable.

This same technology makes branded QR codes possible. When you place a logo in the center of a QR code, you're essentially "damaging" that portion of the data. The error correction algorithms kick in and reconstruct the missing information from the surrounding modules. As long as you stay within the error correction budget, the code scans just fine.

QR codes offer four levels of error correction, each allowing a different percentage of the code to be obscured:

| Level | Data Recovery | Logo Coverage |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| L (Low) | 7% | Not recommended for logos |
| M (Medium) | 15% | Small logos possible |
| Q (Quartile) | 25% | Standard logo size |
| H (High) | 30% | Largest safe logo size |

Most QR generators default to Level M or Q. When adding a logo, you'll want Level H to maximize the space available for your branding while maintaining reliable scannability.

## Designing a Logo That Works

Not every logo translates well to the confined space at the center of a QR code. The most successful branded codes use simplified versions of their marks—think app icons rather than full wordmarks.

Square and circular logos work best because they nest naturally into the QR code's grid structure. A wide horizontal logo, on the other hand, would need to be shrunk so small that it becomes illegible, or stretched across multiple data modules in a way that compromises scannability.

Consider what your logo looks like at 50 pixels wide. If the essential elements remain recognizable at that size, it will work beautifully in a QR code. If fine details disappear into mush, you'll want to use a simplified version—perhaps just an icon, monogram, or stylized letter.

Color presents another consideration. High contrast between your logo and the QR code background ensures both elements remain distinct. A pale logo on a light QR code creates visual confusion and can interfere with scanning. Bold, saturated colors photograph better under varied lighting conditions, which matters because most scans happen on phones held at awkward angles under fluorescent lights or direct sun.

Transparency can be your friend here. A PNG logo with a transparent background lets the QR code's white space show through, creating a cleaner integration than a logo sitting on an opaque rectangle. The logo appears to float within the code rather than being stamped on top of it.

## The Technical Requirements

When preparing your logo file for QR code insertion, format and resolution matter more than you might expect.

PNG remains the gold standard for QR code logos. The format supports transparency, compresses without quality loss, and renders crisply at any size. JPEG works in a pinch, but compression artifacts can create fuzzy edges that look unprofessional when embedded in the sharp geometry of a QR code.

Resolution should be at least 300x300 pixels for the logo file, even though it will display much smaller. This headroom ensures the logo remains sharp when the final QR code is printed at larger sizes—think banners, posters, or vehicle wraps where the code might be two feet wide.

SVG files offer the ultimate flexibility if your QR generator supports them. As vector graphics, SVGs scale infinitely without quality loss. Your logo will look identical whether the QR code ends up on a business card or a billboard.

File size matters less than you'd think. Modern QR generators handle the compositing server-side, so a 500KB logo file won't slow down your code generation. That said, keeping files under 2MB is good practice simply because larger files take longer to upload.

## Placement and Sizing

The center of a QR code isn't arbitrary—it's the safest place for a logo because QR codes encode their most critical data around the edges and in the three large positioning squares at the corners. The center contains data too, but error correction can most easily compensate for missing information there.

Sizing your logo requires balancing visibility against reliability. Too small and no one notices it. Too large and the code won't scan. The sweet spot for most logos falls between 20% and 25% of the code's total area.

Here's a practical way to think about it: if your QR code is 300 pixels wide, your logo should be roughly 60-75 pixels wide. That's large enough to be immediately recognizable while leaving plenty of data intact for scanning.

Some logos benefit from a small buffer zone—a thin ring of white space separating the logo from the surrounding QR modules. This visual breathing room prevents the logo from feeling cramped and can actually improve scanning reliability by creating a cleaner boundary between the logo and the data regions.

## Testing Before You Print

Every branded QR code should survive rigorous testing before it goes to production. The consequences of a non-scanning code range from mildly embarrassing (a social media post that doesn't work) to genuinely expensive (10,000 printed menus that need reprinting).

Start by scanning the code on at least three different devices: an iPhone, a recent Android phone, and an older phone if you can find one. Camera quality and QR scanning algorithms vary significantly across devices and manufacturers. A code that scans instantly on your brand-new iPhone might struggle on a three-year-old budget Android.

Lighting conditions deserve attention too. Scan under bright lights, in dim rooms, and outdoors in direct sunlight. Reflections and shadows can interfere with scanning in ways that aren't obvious when you're designing at your desk.

Print a test copy at the intended final size and scan that physical version. Screens are forgiving—print is not. Ink spread, paper texture, and color accuracy all affect real-world scannability. A code that works perfectly on screen might fail when printed on glossy paper that creates glare, or on textured stock that breaks up the module edges.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

The most frequent error is simply making the logo too large. Enthusiasm for branding overtakes technical constraints, and the result is a code that scans unreliably or not at all. When in doubt, go smaller. A small logo that scans every time beats a large logo that fails 20% of the time.

Placing logos off-center rarely works well. The corners of a QR code contain the positioning patterns that scanners use to orient the code—covering these makes the code unreadable. The center is the only safe zone for logo placement.

Low contrast between the logo and the code causes problems that aren't always obvious during design. A medium-gray logo on a black QR code might look sophisticated on your monitor, but smartphone cameras in auto-exposure mode may not distinguish the elements clearly. Stick with strong contrast: dark logos on light codes, or light logos on dark codes.

Inverting colors without understanding the implications trips up many first-time designers. QR codes can work with light modules on dark backgrounds, but scanners expect dark-on-light by default. If you invert the color scheme, test exhaustively across devices. Some older phones and third-party scanning apps don't handle inverted codes well.

Finally, forgetting to use high error correction is a silent killer. A code generated with Level L error correction leaves almost no room for a logo. Always verify that your generator is using Level H (30%) error correction before adding any branding element.

## Creating Your Branded QR Code

With QRWolf, adding a logo takes just a few clicks. After entering your content and destination, navigate to the Style step and select the Logo tab. Upload your image file, adjust the size slider to find the right balance between visibility and scannability, and preview the result in real-time.

The preview updates instantly as you make changes, so you can experiment with different logo sizes and see immediately whether the code remains scannable. Once you're satisfied, download in PNG for digital use or SVG for print production.

Logo upload is available on [Pro and Business plans](/plans), along with advanced styling options like custom colors, gradient fills, and decorative frames. Free users can still customize colors and patterns—adding your brand colors to a QR code makes a significant visual impact even without a logo.
