"What's the WiFi password?" It's the most asked question in every home, office, cafe, and Airbnb. Usually followed by an awkward exchange where someone squints at the router, tries to remember if it's case-sensitive, and eventually just hands over their phone showing a screenshot.

**WiFi QR codes** eliminate this friction entirely. Guests scan a code, tap connect, and they're online. No typing, no spelling out "lowercase L or number one?", no password sharing via text message.

## How WiFi QR Codes Work

A WiFi QR code encodes your network credentials in a standardized format that smartphones recognize. When scanned, the phone's operating system parses the data and offers to connect automatically.

The encoded format looks like this:

```
WIFI:T:WPA;S:MyNetworkName;P:MyPassword123;H:false;;
```

Breaking it down:
- `T:WPA` - Security type (WPA, WPA2, WEP, or nopass)
- `S:NetworkName` - Your network's SSID
- `P:Password` - The network password
- `H:false` - Whether the network is hidden (true/false)

WiFi QR codes work on iOS 11+, Android 10+, and most modern smartphones. The phone's built-in camera app handles the connection—no special QR scanner app needed.

## Creating a WiFi QR Code

### What You'll Need

1. **Network name (SSID)** - Exactly as it appears in WiFi settings
2. **Password** - Case-sensitive, exact characters
3. **Security type** - Usually WPA/WPA2 for modern networks

### Step-by-Step Process

1. Go to [QRWolf's WiFi QR generator](/create)
2. Select "WiFi" as the QR type
3. Enter your network name exactly as it appears
4. Enter the password (it's hidden for security)
5. Select your encryption type (WPA2 for most networks)
6. Check "Hidden network" if your SSID isn't broadcast
7. Customize colors and style if desired
8. Download as PNG or SVG

### Testing Your Code

Before printing or sharing:

1. **Turn off your WiFi** on your testing device
2. **Forget the network** if previously connected
3. **Scan the QR code** with your camera
4. **Verify it connects** without manual password entry

Test on both iPhone and Android if possible—they handle WiFi QR codes slightly differently.

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
If connection fails, double-check the password for special characters. Characters like `\`, `;`, and `,` need careful handling in some QR generators. QRWolf handles escaping automatically.

## WiFi QR Code Use Cases

### Home Networks

**Guest network access**: Create a separate guest network and share it via QR code. Keep your main network private while still being hospitable.

Display options:
- Framed print near the entrance
- Small card on the coffee table
- Sticker on the refrigerator

### Short-Term Rentals

Airbnb and VRBO hosts love WiFi QR codes because:

- No back-and-forth messages about the password
- Guests connect instantly on arrival
- Looks professional in the welcome packet
- Works even without cell service (offline QR scanning)

**Pro tip**: Include the QR code in your digital guidebook and as a physical sign near the router.

### Cafes and Restaurants

Stop your staff from repeating the WiFi password 50 times a day:

| Placement | Visibility | Best For |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Table tents | High | Sit-down restaurants |
| Counter signs | Medium | Coffee shops |
| Menu insert | Medium | Any establishment |
| Receipt footer | Low | Takeaway focused |
| Wall poster | High | Waiting areas |

### Office Environments

Create separate QR codes for:

- **Guest WiFi** - In conference rooms and reception
- **Employee WiFi** - In break rooms (for personal devices)
- **IoT network** - For smart devices and printers

This keeps networks segmented while making access easy.

### Events and Conferences

Event WiFi is notoriously frustrating. WiFi QR codes solve this at scale:

- Print on badges or lanyards
- Display on presentation slides
- Include in event app
- Post at registration desk

### Retail Stores

Free WiFi increases dwell time and customer satisfaction:

- Place QR codes near fitting rooms
- Display at checkout counters
- Include on shopping bags

## Security Considerations

### The Password Exposure Risk

WiFi QR codes contain your password in plain text (within the QR encoding). Anyone who scans the code can potentially extract the password using QR decoder tools.

**Mitigation strategies:**

1. **Use a guest network** - Keep your main network private
2. **Change passwords regularly** - Rotate guest network passwords monthly
3. **Monitor connected devices** - Most routers show connected clients
4. **Use network isolation** - Prevent guest devices from seeing each other

### When NOT to Use WiFi QR Codes

- Corporate networks with individual authentication
- Networks with access to sensitive systems
- High-security environments
- Networks where you need to track individual users

<Callout type="warning" title="Security Note">
Never create a WiFi QR code for a network that has access to sensitive data, security cameras, or smart home controls without proper network segmentation.
</Callout>

### Enterprise Alternatives

For business environments needing individual authentication:

- **Captive portal** - Users authenticate via web page
- **RADIUS authentication** - Enterprise-grade individual logins
- **MAC filtering** - Whitelist specific devices
- **Certificate-based auth** - Most secure, complex setup

## Design Best Practices

### Size Matters

WiFi QR codes need to be large enough to scan reliably:

| Use Case | Minimum Size |
|----------|--------------|
| Table tent | 1.5" × 1.5" |
| Wall poster | 3" × 3" |
| Event badge | 1" × 1" |
| Business card | 0.75" × 0.75" |

### Contrast is Critical

- Black on white works best
- Dark blue/green on white also works
- Avoid low-contrast color combinations
- Never use gradients in the QR pattern itself

### Include Context

A QR code alone isn't self-explanatory. Always include:

- "Scan to connect to WiFi"
- Network name (for verification)
- Your branding (logo, colors)

### Frame or No Frame?

Adding a frame with "SCAN ME" or "WiFi" increases scan rates by making the purpose obvious. QRWolf includes frame options in the style editor.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Connection Failed" After Scanning

**Causes:**
- Incorrect password in QR code
- Wrong security type selected
- Network out of range
- Network at capacity

**Fixes:**
- Regenerate with correct credentials
- Verify security type in router settings
- Move closer to access point
- Check router client limits

### QR Code Won't Scan

**Causes:**
- Code too small
- Poor lighting
- Damaged or blurry print
- Low contrast colors

**Fixes:**
- Reprint larger
- Improve lighting conditions
- Use high-resolution source file
- Increase color contrast

### Connects But No Internet

**Causes:**
- Captive portal blocking
- DNS issues
- Bandwidth throttling
- ISP outage

**Fixes:**
- Open browser to trigger portal
- Check router DNS settings
- Verify ISP connection
- Test from another device

## Advanced: Dynamic WiFi QR Codes

Standard WiFi QR codes are static—the password is encoded directly. But what if you need to change the password regularly?

**Dynamic WiFi QR codes** don't encode the password directly. Instead, they link to a page that displays current credentials. Benefits:

- Change password without reprinting codes
- Add terms of service acceptance
- Collect email addresses before providing access
- Track who's accessing your network

This approach works well for businesses that rotate passwords weekly or monthly.
